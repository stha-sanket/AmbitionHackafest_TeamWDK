DISEASE NAME: COMMON COLD


## Overview
The common cold is an illness affecting your nose and throat. Most often, it's harmless, but it might not feel that way. Germs called viruses cause a common cold.
Often, adults may have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have colds more often.
Most people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider.
Illnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections.

## Symptoms
Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. Symptoms vary. They can include:
- Runny or stuffy nose.
- Sore or scratchy throat.
- Cough.
- Sneezing.
- Generally feeling unwell.
- Slight body aches or a mild headache.
- Low-grade fever.
The mucus from your nose may start out clear and become thicker and yellow or green. This change is normal. Most often, it doesn't mean that you have a bacterial illness.

## When to see a doctor
For adults.Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. But see your health care provider if you have:
- Symptoms that get worse or do not get better.
- Fever greater than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius) that lasts more than three days.
- Fever returning after a fever-free period.
- Shortness of breath.
- Wheezing.
- Intense sore throat, headache or sinus pain.
For children.Most children with a common cold don't need to see a health care provider. Get medical care right away if your child has any of the following:
- Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in newborns up to 12 weeks.
- Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any age.
- More-intense symptoms, such as headache, throat pain or cough.
- Trouble with breathing or wheezing.
- Ear pain.
- Fussiness or drowsiness that isn't typical.
- No interest in eating.

## Causes
Many viruses can cause a common cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.
A cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:
- Droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.
- Hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.
- Sharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.
- Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.

## Risk factors
These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:
- Age.Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.
- Weakened immune system.Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.
- Time of year.Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.
- Smoking.Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.
- Exposure.Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.

## Complications
These conditions can occur along with your cold:
- Middle ear infection.This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.
- Asthma.A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.
- Sinusitis.In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.
- Other illnesses.A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.

## Prevention
There's no vaccine for the common cold. You can take these steps to slow the spread of the virus and prevent illness:
- Wash your hands.Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
- Clean and disinfect.Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.
- Cover your cough.Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.
- Don't share.Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.
- Stay away from people with colds.Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.
- Review your child care center's policies.Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.
- Take care of yourself.Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.

DISEASE NAME: COMMON COLD


## Diagnosis
You usually don't need medical care for a common cold. But if symptoms get worse or don't go away, see your health care provider.
Most people with a common cold can be diagnosed by their symptoms. Your care provider may take a nasal or throat swab to rule out other illnesses. A chest X-ray may be ordered to rule out a lung illness.

## Treatment
There's no cure for the common cold. Most cases of the common cold get better without treatment within 7 to 10 days. But a cough may last a few more days.
The best thing you can do is take care of yourself while your body heals. Care tips include:
- Rest.
- Drink plenty of liquids.
- Humidify the air.
- Use saline nasal rinses.
Antibiotics do not treat cold viruses. They are used to treat illnesses caused by bacteria.

## Pain relievers
Pain relievers you can buy without a prescription can lessen the discomfort of a sore throat, headache or fever.
For adults.Nonprescription pain relief for adults includes:
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).
- Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).
For children.Guidelines for pain relief medicines for children include the following:
- Do not give children or teenagers aspirin. Aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare life-threatening condition, in children or teenagers who have the flu or chickenpox.
- Use children-strength, nonprescription pain relievers. These include children's acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others).
- For children younger than 3 months old, don't use acetaminophen until your baby has been seen by a health care provider.
- Don't give ibuprofen to a child younger than 6 months old or to children who are vomiting frequently.
- Use these medicines for the shortest time possible and follow label directions to avoid side effects.
- Call your health care provider if you have questions about the right dose.

## Decongestant nasal sprays
For adults.Adults can use decongestant drops or sprays for up to five days. These help a stuffy nose. Prolonged use can cause the return of symptoms.
For children.Children younger than 6 years old shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays. Talk to your doctor before using nasal decongestants in children older than 6 years.

## Cough syrups
Nonprescription cough and cold medicines are used to treat the symptoms of coughs and colds, not the underlying disease. Research suggests that these medicines don't work any better to treat colds than a placebo, an inactive medicine used in research.
For adults.Follow these tips for nonprescription cough and cold medicines:
- Read and follow the label directions.
- Don't take two medicines with the same active ingredient, such as an antihistamine, decongestant or pain reliever. Too much of a single ingredient could lead to an accidental overdose.
For children.Nonprescription cough and cold medicines aren't typically recommended for children. These medicines have potentially serious side effects, including fatal overdoses in children younger than 2 years old. Talk to your child's doctor before using any nonprescription cough and cold medicine in children.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
To make yourself as comfortable as possible when you have a cold, try these tips:
- Drink plenty of fluids.Water, juice, clear broth or warm lemon water are good choices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can increase fluid loss.
- Sip warm liquids.Chicken soup, tea, warm apple juice or other warm liquids can soothe a sore throat and loosen a stuffy nose. Honey may help coughs in adults and children who are older than age 1. Try it in hot tea. Do not give honey to children younger than 1 year old because of the risk of an illness called infant botulism.
- Rest.Rest as much as possible. Stay home from work or school if you have a fever or a bad cough. Do not go out if you are drowsy after taking medicine.
- Adjust your room's temperature and humidity.Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier can help with stuffiness and coughing. Clean your humidifier as directed to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.
- Use a saltwater gargle.A saltwater gargle of 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (1250 to 2500 milligrams) of table salt in 4 to 8 fluid ounces (120 to 240 milliliters) of warm water can help soothe a sore throat. Gargle the solution and then spit it out. Most children younger than 6 years aren't able to gargle properly.
- Try other throat soothers.Use ice chips, lozenges or hard candy to soothe a sore throat. Use caution when giving lozenges or hard candy to children because they can choke on them. Don't give lozenges or hard candy to children younger than 6 years.
- Try saline nasal drops or sprays.Saline nasal drops or sprays can keep nasal passages moist and loosen mucus.
- Use a suction bulb for younger children.In infants and younger children, apply saline nasal drops, wait for a short period and then use a suction bulb to draw mucus out of each nostril. Insert the bulb syringe about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 12 millimeters).

## Alternative medicine
The science isn't clear on alternative cold remedies such as vitamin C, echinacea and zinc. Because studies of alternative cold remedies in children are limited, these remedies are most often not recommended for use in children. Here's an update on some popular choices:

## Vitamin C
Taking vitamin C is unlikely to prevent the common cold. Some studies have found that taking vitamin C before cold symptoms start may shorten the length of time you have symptoms.

## Echinacea
Study results for echinacea are mixed. Some studies show no benefit. Others show that echinacea may lessen symptoms and shorten the recovery time when taken in the early stages of a cold. Different types of echinacea used in different studies may be a reason for mixed results.
Echinacea seems to work best if you take it when you notice cold symptoms and continue it for 7 to 10 days. It appears to be safe for healthy adults, but it can interact with many drugs. Check with your doctor before taking echinacea or any other supplement.

## Zinc
Several studies show that zinc supplements may reduce the length of a cold. But research has turned up mixed results about zinc and colds.
Some studies show that zinc lozenges or syrup reduce the length of a cold by about one day, especially when taken within 24 to 48 hours of the first signs and symptoms of a cold.
Zinc also has potentially harmful side effects. Intranasal zinc might cause permanent damage to the sense of smell. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning against using zinc-containing nasal cold remedies because they are associated with a long-lasting or permanent loss of smell.
Talk to your doctor before considering the use of zinc to prevent or reduce the length of colds.

## Preparing for your appointment
If you or your child has cold symptoms that don't go away or get worse, make an appointment with your health care provider. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
Make a list of:
- Your or your child's symptomsand when they began.
- Key personal information,including major stresses, other health conditions and exposure to people who've been ill.
- Medicines, vitamins or supplementsyou or your child takes.
- Questionsto ask your health care provider.
For a common cold, questions to ask may include:
- What's likely causing these symptoms?
- Are there other possible causes?
- Are tests needed?
- What treatment approach do you recommend?
- What treatments should be avoided?
- How soon do you expect symptoms to improve?
- Is my child or am I contagious? When is it safe to return to school or work?
- What self-care steps might help?
- My child or I have other health conditions. How can we manage them together?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care provider is likely to ask you questions, such as:
- How long have you had symptoms?
- Have symptoms been continuous?
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the seriousness of the symptoms?
- Did symptoms improve and then worsen?
- What, if anything, seems to improve the symptoms?
- What, if anything, worsens symptoms?
Your care provider will ask additional questions based on your answers, symptoms and needs. Preparing for questions will help you make the most of your time with the provider.

DISEASE NAME: INFLUENZA (FLU)


## Overview
Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the "stomach flu" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.
Most people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications.
Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.

## Symptoms
The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May.
Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.
Other common flu symptoms include:
- Fever.
- Cough.
- Headache.
- Muscle aches.
- Feeling very tired.
- Sweating and chills.
In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu.
In some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.

## When to see a doctor
Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional.
If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.
If you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:
- Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.
- Chest pain or pressure.
- Ongoing dizziness.
- Hard to wake up or confusion.
- Dehydration.
- Seizures.
- Worsening of existing medical conditions.
- Severe weakness or muscle pain.
Emergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:
- Fast breathing or ribs that pull in with each breath.
- Gray or blue lips or nail beds.
- No tears when crying and a dry mouth, along with not needing to urinate.
- Symptoms, such as fever or cough, that get better but then come back or get worse.

## Causes
Influenza is caused by viruses. These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
It's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time.
Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often.
A person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.

## Risk factors
There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection.

## Older and younger age
Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes.

## Living conditions
People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu.

## Weakened immune system
An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine.

## Chronic illnesses
Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease.

## Race or ethnicity
In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza.

## Aspirin therapy
Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus.

## Pregnancy
Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters.

## Obesity
People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications.

## Complications
If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects.
But people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications.
Getting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system.
Other complications may be:
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- Muscle damage, called rhabdomyolysis, or muscle swelling, called myositis.
- Toxic shock syndrome.
- Worsening of a chronic illness, such as asthma or kidney disease.

## Prevention

## Flu vaccines at Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine.
Getting a flu vaccine lowers:
- The risk of getting the flu. If the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, the flu vaccine helps protect a newborn from the flu too.
- The risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to the flu.
- The risk of dying of the flu.
The 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season.
The vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray.
For older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle.
If you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin.
The nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as:
- People who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past.
- Pregnant people.
- Young people who take aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine.
- People with weakened immune systems and people who are caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems.
- Children between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.
- People who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu.
- People with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant.
Check with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. If you can take the nasal spray flu vaccine, you may be able to do so, or give it to an eligible child, without seeing a healthcare professional.
There also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response.
If you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine.
The first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional.
Also, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine.

## Controlling the spread of infection
The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including:
- Wash your hands.Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing.
- Avoid touching your face.Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places.
- Cover your coughs and sneezes.Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.
- Clean surfaces.Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.
- Avoid crowds.The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection.
Also avoid anyone who is sick.
If you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others.

DISEASE NAME: INFLUENZA (FLU)


## Diagnosis

## Flu vaccines at Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic offers flu shots in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.
To diagnose the flu, also called influenza, your healthcare professional does a physical exam, looks for symptoms of flu and possibly orders a test that detects flu viruses.
The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. During times when flu is widespread, you may not need a flu test.
But a test for flu may be suggested to help guide your care or to know if you could spread the virus to others. A flu test may be done by a pharmacy, your healthcare professional's office or in the hospital. For people age 2 and older, a test you can take at home may be available. If you do use an at-home test, let your healthcare professional know the results. You may need to confirm the results, positive or negative, with a test from your healthcare team.
Types of flu tests you may have include:
- Molecular tests.These tests look for genetic material from the flu virus. Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You also may hear this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test.
- Antigen tests.These tests look for viral proteins called antigens. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are one example of antigen tests.
It's possible to have a test to diagnose both flu and other respiratory illness, such as COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. You may have both COVID-19 and influenza at the same time.

## Treatment
If you have a severe infection or are at high risk of complications from a flu infection, your healthcare professional may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat the flu. These medicines can include oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir (Xofluza) and zanamivir (Relenza).
You take oseltamivir and baloxavir by mouth. You inhale zanamivir using a device similar to an asthma inhaler. Zanamivir shouldn't be used by anyone with certain chronic respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease.
People who are in the hospital may be prescribed peramivir (Rapivab), which is given in a vein.
These medicines may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications.
Antiviral medicine may cause side effects. The side effects often are listed on the prescription information. In general, antiviral medicine side effects may include breathing symptoms, nausea, vomiting or loose stools called diarrhea.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
If you have the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:
- Drink plenty of liquids.Choose water, juice and warm soups to help keep fluids in your body.
- Rest.Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection. You may need to change your activity level, depending on your symptoms.
- Consider pain relievers.Use acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for fever, headache or achiness associated with influenza. Children and teens recovering from flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition.
To help control the spread of influenza in your community, stay home and keep sick children home until the fever is gone, without the use of medicine, for 24 hours. Unless you're going to a medical appointment, avoid being around other people until you're feeling better. If you need to leave your home to get medical care, wear a face mask. Wash your hands often.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19)


## Overview
COVID-19, also called coronavirus disease 2019, is an illness caused by a virus. The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020.
The virus that causesCOVID-19spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. Many people withCOVID-19have no symptoms or mild illness. But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions,COVID-19can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death.
Staying up to date on yourCOVID-19vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due toCOVID-19and death fromCOVID-19. Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene.
Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months.

## Symptoms
TypicalCOVID-19symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus.
Symptoms can include:
- Dry cough.
- Shortness of breath.
- Loss of taste or smell.
- Extreme tiredness, called fatigue.
- Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea.
- Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches.
- Fever or chills.
- Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat.
People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive forCOVID-19are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms ofCOVID-19illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spreadCOVID-19to others.
Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start.
Most people withCOVID-19have mild to moderate symptoms. ButCOVID-19can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness.
COVID-19may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness.
- In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body.
- In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs.
- Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital.
- Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body.
Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened toMIS-C. In adults, the name isMIS-A.

## When to see a doctor
Contact a healthcare professional if you test positive forCOVID-19. If you have symptoms and need to test forCOVID-19, or you've been exposed to someone withCOVID-19, a healthcare professional can help.
People who are at high risk of serious illness may get medicine to block the spread of theCOVID-19virus in the body. Or your healthcare team may plan regular checks to monitor your health.
Get emergency help right away for any of these symptoms:
- Can't catch your breath or have problems breathing.
- Skin, lips or nail beds that are pale, gray or blue.
- New confusion.
- Trouble staying awake or waking up.
- Chest pain or pressure that is constant.
This list doesn't include every emergency symptom. If you or a person you're taking care of has symptoms that worry you, get help. Let the healthcare team know about a positive test forCOVID-19or symptoms of the illness.

## Causes
COVID-19is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called SARS-CoV-2.
The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. When people withCOVID-19cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with theCOVID-19virus.
The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze or cough, for example. The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. And a person may touch a surface that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them.
It's possible to getCOVID-19more than once.
- Over time, the body's defense against theCOVID-19virus can fade.
- A person may be exposed to so much of the virus that it breaks through their immune defense.
- As a virus infects a group of people, the virus copies itself. During this process, the genetic code can randomly change in each copy. The changes are called mutations. If the coronavirus that causesCOVID-19changes in ways that make previous infections or vaccination less effective at preventing infection, people can get sick again.
The virus that causesCOVID-19can infect some pets. Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms. It's rare for a person to getCOVID-19from a pet.

## Risk factors
The main risk factors forCOVID-19are:
- If someone you live with hasCOVID-19.
- If you spend time in places with poor air flow and a higher number of people when the virus is spreading.
- If you spend more than 30 minutes in close contact with someone who hasCOVID-19.
Many factors affect your risk of catching the virus that causesCOVID-19. How long you are in contact, if the space has good air flow and your activities all affect the risk. Also, if you or others wear masks, if someone hasCOVID-19symptoms and how close you are affects your risk. Close contact includes sitting and talking next to one another, for example, or sharing a car or bedroom.
It seems to be rare for people to catch the virus that causesCOVID-19from an infected surface. While the virus is shed in waste, called stool,COVID-19infection from places such as a public bathroom is not common.

## Serious COVID-19 illness risk factors
Some people are at a higher risk of seriousCOVID-19illness than others. This includes people age 65 and older as well as babies younger than 6 months. Those age groups have the highest risk of needing hospital care forCOVID-19.
Not every risk factor for seriousCOVID-19illness is known. People of all ages who have no other medical issues have needed hospital care forCOVID-19.
Known risk factors for serious illness include people who have not gotten aCOVID-19vaccine. Serious illness also is a higher risk for people who have:
- Sickle cell disease or thalassemia.
- Serious heart diseases and possibly high blood pressure.
- Chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases.
People with dementia or Alzheimer's also are at higher risk, as are people with brain and nervous system conditions such as stroke. Smoking increases the risk of seriousCOVID-19illness. And people with a body mass index in the overweight category or obese category may have a higher risk as well.
Other medical conditions that may raise the risk of serious illness fromCOVID-19include:
- Cancer or a history of cancer.
- Type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
- Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, some medicines, orHIV.
- Pregnancy.
This list is not complete. Factors linked to a health issue may raise the risk of seriousCOVID-19illness too. Examples are a medical condition where people live in a group home, or lack of access to medical care. Also, people with more than one health issue, or people of older age who also have health issues have a higher chance of severe illness.

## Complications
Complications ofCOVID-19include long-term loss of taste and smell, skin rashes, and sores. The illness can cause trouble breathing or pneumonia. Medical issues a person already manages may get worse.
Complications of severeCOVID-19illness can include:
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the body's organs do not get enough oxygen.
- Shock caused by the infection or heart problems.
- Overreaction of the immune system, called the inflammatory response.
- Blood clots.
- Kidney injury.

## Post-COVID-19 syndrome
After aCOVID-19infection, some people report that symptoms continue for months, or they develop new symptoms. This syndrome has often been called long COVID, or post-COVID-19. You might hear it called long haulCOVID-19, post-COVID conditions or PASC. That's short for post-acute sequelae ofSARS-CoV-2.
Other infections, such as the flu and polio, can lead to long-term illness. But the virus that causesCOVID-19has only been studied since it began to spread in 2019. So, research into the specific effects of long-termCOVID-19symptoms continues.
Researchers do think that post-COVID-19syndrome can happen after an illness of any severity.
Getting aCOVID-19vaccine may help prevent post-COVID-19syndrome.

## Prevention
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends aCOVID-19vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. TheCOVID-19vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused byCOVID-19.
TheCOVID-19vaccines available in the United States are:
- Pfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19vaccine 2024-2025 formula.This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older.Among people with a typical immune system:Children ages 6 months up to age 4 years are up to date after three doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19vaccine. If a child has had one dose of a previous Pfizer-BioNTechCOVIDvaccine, two doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19vaccine will bring the child up to date. If a child had two doses previously, one dose of the 2024-2025 formula will bring the child up to date.People age 5 and older are up to date with one 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19vaccine.

Among people with a typical immune system:
- People age 12 years and older are up to date if they've had one dose of a 2024-2025 NovavaxCOVID-19vaccine.
In general, people age 5 and older with typical immune systems can get any vaccine approved or authorized for their age. They usually don't need to get the same vaccine each time.
Some people should get all their vaccine doses from the same vaccine maker, including:
- Children ages 6 months to 4 years.
- People age 5 years and older with weakened immune systems.
- People age 12 and older who have had one shot of the Novavax vaccine should get the second Novavax shot in the two-dose series.
Talk to your healthcare professional if you have any questions about the vaccines for you or your child. Your healthcare team can help you if:
- The vaccine you or your child got earlier isn't available.
- You don't know which vaccine you or your child received.
- You or your child started a vaccine series but couldn't finish it due to side effects.
People with weakened immune systems
Your healthcare team may suggest added doses ofCOVID-19vaccine if you have a moderately or seriously weakened immune system. TheFDAhas also authorized the monoclonal antibody pemivibart (Pemgarda) to preventCOVID-19in some people with weakened immune systems.
Control the spread of infection
In addition to vaccination, there are other ways to stop the spread of the virus that causesCOVID-19.
If you are at a higher risk of serious illness, talk to your healthcare professional about how best to protect yourself. Know what to do if you get sick so you can quickly start treatment.
If you feel ill or haveCOVID-19, stay home and away from others, including pets, if possible. Avoid sharing household items such as dishes or towels if you're sick.
In general, make it a habit to:
- Test forCOVID-19.If you have symptoms ofCOVID-19test for the infection. Or test five days after you came in contact with the virus.
- Help from afar.Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms, if possible.
- Wash your hands.Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
- Cover your coughs and sneezes.Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.
- Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces.For example, clean doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters regularly.
Try to spread out in crowded public areas, especially in places with poor airflow. This is important if you have a higher risk of serious illness.
TheCDCrecommends that people wear a mask in indoor public spaces if you're in an area with a high number of people withCOVID-19in the hospital. They suggest wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, that fits well and is comfortable.

## Travel and COVID-19
Travel brings people together from areas where illnesses may be at higher levels. Masks can help slow the spread of respiratory diseases in general, includingCOVID-19. Masks help the most in places with low air flow and where you are in close contact with other people. Also, masks can help if the places you travel to or through have a high level of illness.
Masking is especially important if you or a companion have a high risk of serious illness fromCOVID-19.

DISEASE NAME: CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19)


## Diagnosis
If you have symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, or you've been exposed to theCOVID-19virus, contact your healthcare team. Let them know if you've had close contact with anyone diagnosed withCOVID-19.
In the United States, at-homeCOVID-19tests are available. Free tests can be mailed to U.S. addresses, or you can purchase tests in stores, pharmacies or online. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, approves or authorizes the tests. On theFDAwebsite, you can find a list of the tests that are validated and their expiration dates. You also can check with your healthcare professional before buying a test if you have any concerns.
When taking a test at home, read the directions that come with the test carefully. Follow the instructions exactly to get as accurate a result as possible.
COVID-19tests also are available from healthcare professionals, some pharmacies and clinics, or at community testing sites.
Here are some guidelines for when to take aCOVID-19test:
- If you haveCOVID-19symptoms, test for the illness right away.
- If you were exposed to theCOVID-19virus but don't have symptoms, wait at least five days after exposure then test.
- If you have symptoms and tested positive forCOVID-19within the last 30 days, you can test again. But if you were just exposed to the coronavirus and don't have symptoms, you don't need to test.
Also, testing before an event or contact with people at high risk of serious illness helps prevent the spread of the virus that causesCOVID-19.
COVID-19tests use a sample taken from your nose or throat, or a sample of saliva.
Two types of tests can help diagnoseCOVID-19.
- Molecular tests.These tests look for genetic material from theCOVID-19virus.Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You may also see this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test.PCRtests are more accurate than the other type ofCOVID-19test, called an antigen test.PCRtests may be done at home. But they are much more likely to be done by a healthcare professional and processed in a lab.

These tests are useful if you need a quick result.Antigen tests are reliable and accurate, but they are less accurate thanPCRtests. This is especially true if you don't have symptoms. If you take an antigen test and are negative forCOVID-19, take another antigen test after 48 hours to get the most accurate result.

## Understanding test results
If you have a positiveCOVID-19PCRor antigen test, you almost certainly haveCOVID-19. Another test isn't needed.
If you get a negativePCRtest, you most likely do not haveCOVID-19.
If you have a negative antigen test, theFDArecommends that you repeat an antigen test two days after the first test. With or without symptoms, repeating the test helps get the correct diagnosis.
If you test positive, call a healthcare professional immediately to find out what options are available.

## Preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus while sick
To prevent the spread of theCOVID-19virus to others, stay home and apart from anyone you live with for as long as you have worsening symptoms. If you have a weakened immune system, you will likely need to isolate for longer. How long depends on your symptoms and personal health history. Your healthcare professional can advise you on what's best in your situation.
If you must be around others, a face mask helps lower the spread of this coronavirus. During this time, try not to share things like cups or towels, and use a separate bathroom and bedroom. It can help to get more airflow in your home as well.
Once you're feeling better and haven’t had a fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven’t taken medicine for fever during that time, you can go back to being around others. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, return to isolation until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. But listen to the advice of your healthcare professional.
In the five days after isolation, to help prevent the spread of theCOVID-19virus you can wear a mask, wash your hands, keep your distance from others, test forCOVID-19infection and improve airflow. These actions are helpful even if you never had symptoms but tested positive forCOVID-19.

## Treatment
Many people withCOVID-19recover with rest, plenty of fluids and care that manages symptoms. Medicine you can get without a prescription can help, such as:
- Fever reducers.
- Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
- Cough syrup or medicine.
If you are at high risk of seriousCOVID-19illness, your healthcare professional may suggest medicine to prevent mild illness from getting worse. These medicines can include nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid), remdesivir (Veklury) or molnupiravir (Lagevrio).
Paxlovid and Lagevrio are taken by mouth as pills. Veklury is given through a needle in a vein.
If you're very ill, you may need to be treated in the hospital.

## Treatment for serious COVID-19 illness
For people who are in the hospital forCOVID-19care, care is given based on a person's immune system response and the need for oxygen support.
Added oxygen may be given through a tube in the nose. Some people may need to have a tube placed in their airway to push air into the lungs. That's called mechanical ventilation. In very severe situations, a machine called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as ECMO, can be used to mimic the function of the heart and lungs.
Medicines for severeCOVID-19may be remdesivir, baricitinib (Olumiant) and tocilizumab (Actemra), or a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone.
Baricitinib is a pill. Tocilizumab is an injection. Dexamethasone may be either a pill or given through a needle in a vein.
Another option may come from blood donated by people who have recovered fromCOVID-19, called convalescent plasma. The blood is processed to remove blood cells, leaving behind a liquid called plasma that has immune system proteins called antibodies. Convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may be used to help people with a weakened immune system recover fromCOVID-19.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
If you haveCOVID-19, it's important to get plenty of rest, drink fluids and keep an eye on your symptoms. Medicines you can get without a prescription can help manage pain, fever or cough.
If you haveCOVID-19and are staying separate from others, try to keep busy and help your body clear out the infection. Some things that might help are:
- Eat healthy meals.
- Get enough sleep.
- Relaxation exercises.
- Do activities you enjoy.
- Connect with friends and family, such as with phone or video calls.
People who haveCOVID-19or care for someone with the illness may feel new or worse symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. If you or a loved one need help with managing the stress of illness, isolation or caregiving, contact your healthcare professional. Consider asking for a referral to a mental health professional.

## Preparing for your appointment
To be treated forCOVID-19, you may start by seeing your healthcare professional. Or you may be referred immediately to a specialist trained in treating infectious diseases.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance. Make a list of:
- Your symptoms,including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment.
- Your recent travels,including any international travels.
- Key personal information,including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history.
- All medicines, vitamins or other supplementsyou take, including the doses.
- Questions to askyour doctor.
Take a family member or friend along, if possible, to help you remember the information you're given. Bring only one or two people. Check before you go to the appointment, as your hospital or clinic may have visitor restrictions.
Some basic questions to ask your health care team include:
- How likely is it thatCOVID-19is causing my symptoms?
- What are other possible causes for my symptoms?
- What tests do I need?
- What course of action do you recommend?
- Are there restrictions I need to follow?
- Should I see a specialist?

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care professional is likely to ask you several questions, such as:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Where have you traveled recently?
- Who have you been in close contact with?
- How severe are your symptoms?

DISEASE NAME: STREP THROAT


DISEASE NAME: STREP THROAT


DISEASE NAME: ACUTE SINUSITIS


## Overview
Acute sinusitis causes the spaces inside the nose, known as sinuses, to become inflamed and swollen. Acute sinusitis makes it hard for the sinuses to drain. Mucus builds up.
Acute sinusitis can make it hard to breathe through the nose. The area around the eyes and the face might feel swollen. There might be throbbing face pain or a headache.
The common cold is the usual cause of acute sinusitis. Most often, the condition clears up within a week to 10 days unless there's also an infection caused by bacteria, called a bacterial infection. Home remedies might be all that's needed to treat acute sinusitis. Sinusitis that lasts more than 12 weeks even with medical treatment is called chronic sinusitis.

## Symptoms
Acute sinusitis symptoms often include:
- Thick, yellow or greenish mucus from the nose, known as a runny nose, or down the back of the throat, known as postnasal drip.
- Blocked or stuffy nose, known as congestion. This makes it hard to breathe through the nose.
- Pain, tenderness, swelling and pressure around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead that gets worse when bending over.
Other signs and symptoms include:
- Ear pressure.
- Headache.
- Aching in the teeth.
- Changed sense of smell.
- Cough.
- Bad breath.
- Tiredness.
- Fever.

## When to see a doctor
Most people with acute sinusitis don't need to see a health care provider.
Contact your health care providerif you have any of the following:
- Symptoms that last more than a week.
- Symptoms that get worse after seeming to get better.
- A fever that lasts.
- A history of repeated or chronic sinusitis.
See a health care provider immediatelyif you have symptoms that might mean a serious infection:
- Pain, swelling or redness around the eyes.
- High fever.
- Confusion.
- Double vision or other vision changes.
- Stiff neck.

## Causes
Acute sinusitis is an infection caused by a virus. The common cold is most often the cause. Sometimes, sinuses that are blocked for a time might get a bacterial infection.

## Risk factors
The following can raise the risk of getting sinusitis:
- Hay fever or another allergythat affects the sinuses.
- A common coldthat affects the sinuses.
- A problem inside the nose,such as a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps or tumors.
- A medical conditionsuch as cystic fibrosis or an immune system disorder such as HIV/AIDS.
- Being around smoke,either from smoking or being around others who smoke, known as secondhand smoke.

## Complications
Acute sinusitis doesn't often cause complications. Complications that might happen include:
- Chronic sinusitis.Acute sinusitis can be a flare-up of a long-term problem known as chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks.
- Meningitis.This infection affects the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord.
- Other infections.It's not common. But an infection can spread to the bones, known as osteomyelitis, or to skin, known as cellulitis.
- Vision problems.If the infection spreads to the eye socket, it can reduce vision or cause blindness.

## Prevention
Take these steps to help lower your risk of getting acute sinusitis:
- Stay well.Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections. Wash your hands often with soap and water, such as before meals.
- Manage allergies.Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control.
- Avoid cigarette smoke and polluted air.Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate lungs and inside the nose, known as nasal passages.
- Use a machine that adds moisture to the air, known as a humidifier.If the air in your home is dry, adding moisture to the air may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: ACUTE SINUSITIS


## Diagnosis
A health care provider might ask about symptoms and do an exam. The exam might include feeling for tenderness in the nose and face and looking inside the nose.
Other ways to diagnose acute sinusitis and rule out other conditions include:
- Nasal endoscopy.A health care provider inserts a thin, flexible tube, known as an endoscope, into the nose. A light on the tube allows the provider to see inside the sinuses.
- Imaging studies.A CT scan can show details of the sinuses and nasal area. It's not usually used for simple acute sinusitis. But imaging studies might help rule out other causes.
- Nasal and sinus samples.Lab tests aren't often used to diagnose acute sinusitis. But if the condition doesn't get better with treatment or gets worse, tissue samples from the nose or sinuses might help find the cause.

## Treatment
Most cases of acute sinusitis get better on their own. Self-care is usually all that's needed to ease symptoms.

## Treatments to ease symptoms
The following might help ease sinusitis symptoms:
- Saline nasal spray.Salt water sprayed into the nose many times a day rinses the inside of the nose.
- Nasal corticosteroids.These nasal sprays help prevent and treat swelling. Examples include fluticasone (Flonase Allergy Relief, Flonase Sensimist Allergy Relief, others), budesonide (Rhinocort Allergy), mometasone and beclomethasone (Beconase AQ, Qnasl, others).
- Decongestants.These medicines are available with and without a prescription. They come in liquids, tablets and nasal sprays. Use nasal decongestants for only a few days because they may cause worse stuffiness, known as rebound congestion.
- Allergy medicines.For sinusitis caused by allergies, using allergy medicines might lessen allergy symptoms.
- Pain relievers.Try acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or aspirin available without a prescription.Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than 3, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children.

This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children.

## Antibiotics
Antibiotics don't treat viruses, which are the usual cause of acute sinusitis. Even if bacteria caused the acute sinusitis, called a bacterial infection, it might clear up on its own. So a health care provider might wait and see if the acute sinusitis gets worse before prescribing antibiotics.
But, if you have severe, worsening or long-lasting symptoms, your symptoms might need to be treated with antibiotics. Always take the whole course of antibiotics even after symptoms get better. Stopping antibiotics early might cause symptoms to come back.

## Immunotherapy
For sinusitis caused or made worse by allergies, allergy shots might help. This is known as immunotherapy.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
These steps can help relieve sinusitis symptoms:
- Rest.Rest helps the body fight infection and speed recovery.
- Drink fluids.Keep drinking plenty of fluids.
- Use a warm compress.A warm compress on the nose and forehead might help lessen pressure in the sinuses.
- Keep sinuses moist.Breathing in the steam from a bowl of hot water with a towel over the head might help. Or take a hot shower, breathing in the warm, moist air. This will help ease pain and help mucus drain.
- Rinse the inside of the nose.Use a specially designed squeeze bottle (Sinus Rinse, others) or neti pot. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help clear sinuses.

## Alternative medicine
No alternative therapies have been proved to ease the symptoms of acute sinusitis. Products that have certain herbs in them might be of some help. These therapies have cowslip, gentian root, elderflower, verbena and sorrel in them.
Check with a health care provider before taking herbal or dietary supplements. Be sure they're safe and that they won't get in the way of medicines you take.

## Preparing for your appointment
Here's information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
Make a list of:
- Your symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment, and when they began.
- Key personal information, including whether you have allergies or asthma, and family medical history.
- All medicines, vitamins or other supplements you take, including doses.
- Questions to ask your health care provider.
For acute sinusitis, questions to ask your provider include:
- What's likely causing my symptoms?
- What are other possible causes for my symptoms?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely to go away or be long lasting?
- What's the best course of action?
- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you suggest?
Be sure to ask all the questions you have.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your care provider is likely to ask you questions, such as:
- Do you have symptoms all the time or once in a while?
- How bad are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to make your symptoms better?
- What, if anything, seems to make your symptoms worse?
- Do you smoke or are you around smoke or other pollutants?

DISEASE NAME: TONSILLITIS


DISEASE NAME: TONSILLITIS


DISEASE NAME: ALLERGIES


## Overview
Allergies happen when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance that gets inside the body. These substances are known as allergens. They include pollen, bee venom and pet dander. Allergies also can happen due to certain foods and medicines that don't cause reactions in most people.
The immune system makes protective proteins called antibodies that attack invaders such as germs. But with allergies, the immune system makes antibodies that mark a specific allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. Coming into contact with the allergen causes an immune system reaction that can inflame the skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.
Allergic reactions vary from person to person. They can range from minor irritation to a life-threatening emergency called anaphylaxis. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.

## Symptoms
Allergy symptoms depend on what allergen is involved. The symptoms can affect the airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. Sometimes, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.
Hay fever,also called allergic rhinitis, can cause:
- Sneezing.
- Itching of the skin, nose, eyes or roof of the mouth.
- Runny, stuffy nose.
- Tiredness, also called fatigue.
- Watery, red or swollen eyes, also called allergic conjunctivitis.
A food allergycan cause:
- Tingling in the mouth.
- Swelling of the lips, tongue, face or throat.
- Itchy welts called hives.
- Stuffy nose, sneezing or teary eyes that itch.
- Stomach cramps, vomiting or diarrhea.
- Anaphylaxis.
An insect sting allergycan cause:
- Pain and a large area of swelling called edema at the sting site.
- Itching or hives all over the body.
- Skin warmth and a change in skin color, also called flushing.
- Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath.
- Anaphylaxis.
A medicine allergycan cause:
- Hives.
- Itchy skin or rash.
- Facial swelling.
- Wheezing.
- Shortness of breath.
- Vomiting or diarrhea.
- Feeling dizzy.
- Anaphylaxis.
Atopic dermatitis,an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause skin to:
- Itch.
- Form red or brown patches that may be harder to see on darker skin tones.
- Flake, peel or crack.

## Anaphylaxis
Some types of allergies can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. Certain foods, insect stings and medicines are among the allergens that can set off this life-threatening emergency. Anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock. Other symptoms include:
- Passing out.
- A drop in blood pressure.
- Severe shortness of breath and throat tightness.
- Skin rash with hives or welts.
- Dizziness.
- A rapid, weak pulse.
- Upset stomach, vomiting or diarrhea.
- A sense of doom.

## When to see a doctor
You might see a healthcare professional if you have symptoms that you think are caused by an allergy, and over-the-counter allergy medicines sold without a prescription didn't give you enough relief. If you have symptoms after starting a new medicine for a health condition, call the healthcare professional who prescribed it right away.
For a severe allergic reaction, also called anaphylaxis,call 911 or your local emergency number. Or get emergency medical help. A shot of prescription medicine called epinephrine is needed to treat anaphylaxis. If you carry an epinephrine auto-injector (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others), give yourself a shot right away.
Even if your symptoms get better after an epinephrine shot, go to the emergency room. Healthcare professionals need to make sure your symptoms don't come back when the effects of the shot wear off.
If you've had a severe allergy attack or any symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past, make an appointment to see your healthcare professional. Allergy testing and the creation of a long-term treatment plan to manage anaphylaxis can be a challenge. So you'll likely need to see a doctor called an allergist who finds and treats allergies and other immune system conditions.

## Causes
Various substances can cause allergies. An allergy starts when the immune system mistakes a substance that's usually harmless for a dangerous invader. The immune system then makes antibodies that stay on the alert for that specific allergen. When you're exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies can release some immune system chemicals that cause allergy symptoms.
Common allergy triggers include:
- Airborne allergens,such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mold.
- Certain foods,especially peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk.
- Insect stings,such as from a bee or wasp.
- Medicines,especially penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics.
- Latex or other substances you touch,which can cause allergic skin reactions.

## Risk factors
Risk factors for allergies include:
- Having a family history of asthma or allergies,such as hay fever, hives or eczema.
- Being a child.
- Having asthmaor another allergic condition.

## Complications
Having an allergy raises the risk of certain other health conditions called complications, including:
- Anaphylaxis.If you have severe allergies, that raises your risk of this serious allergic reaction. Foods, medicines, latex and insect stings are the most common triggers of anaphylaxis.
- Asthma.If you have an allergy, you're more likely to have asthma. Asthma is an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing. Often, asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment. This is known as allergy-induced asthma.
- Infections of the sinuses, ears or lungs.Your risk of getting these conditions is higher if you have hay fever or asthma.

## Prevention
Preventing allergic reactions depends on the type of allergy you have. General measures include the following:
- Stay away from known triggers.Do this even if you get treatment for your allergy symptoms. If, for instance, you're allergic to pollen, stay inside with windows and doors closed when pollen is high. If you're allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and wash bedding often. You also can use "mite-proof" covers for items such as pillows, comforters, mattresses and box springs.
- Keep a diary.When trying to figure out what causes your allergic symptoms or makes them worse, track your activities and what you eat. Also note when symptoms happen and what seems to help. This may help you and your healthcare professional find your triggers.
- Wear a medical alert bracelet.If you've had a severe allergic reaction, wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. It lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're not able to speak.

DISEASE NAME: ALLERGIES


## Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves the steps that your healthcare professional takes to find out whether you have an allergy. Your healthcare professional will likely:
- Ask detailed questions about your symptoms.
- Do a physical exam.
- Have you keep a detailed diary of symptoms and possible triggers.
If you have a food allergy, your healthcare professional will likely:
- Ask you to keep a detailed diary of the foods you eat.
- Ask if you've stopped eating the suspected food during the allergy exam.
Your healthcare professional also may recommend one or both of the following tests. Be aware that these allergy tests can give results that might not be accurate.
- Skin test.A healthcare professional uses a tiny needle to prick or scratch your skin and expose you to small amounts of the proteins found in your potential allergens. If you're allergic, you'll likely develop a raised bump called a hive at the test area on your skin. If the test result suggests you don't have an allergy but your healthcare professional still thinks you might, you may need an exam called an intradermal skin test. Your healthcare professional injects a small amount of allergen into the outer layer of the skin.
- Bloodtest.This test measures the amount of antibodies that the blood makes to destroy allergens. These antibodies are called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. The test is known as specific IgE (sIgE) blood testing. It's also commonly called radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or ImmunoCAP testing. Your blood sample is sent to a lab to find out if you're sensitive to suspected allergens.
If your healthcare professional thinks that something other than an allergy is the cause of your symptoms, other tests might be needed to help find the cause.

## Treatment
Allergy treatments include:
- Staying away from allergy triggers, also known as avoidance.Your healthcare professional helps you take steps to spot and stay away from your allergy triggers. Often, this is the most important step in preventing allergic reactions and curbing symptoms.
- Medicines.Depending on your allergy, medicines can help turn down your immune system's reaction and ease symptoms. Your healthcare professional might suggest medicine in the form of pills or liquid, nasal sprays, or eye drops.
- Immunotherapy.This treatment can help treat severe allergies. It also can help for allergies that don't get better with other treatments. Immunotherapy involves getting a series of shots of purified allergen extracts. These extracts train the immune system not to overreact to your suspected allergen. Most often, the shots are given over a period of a few years.Another form of immunotherapy is a tablet that's placed under the tongue until it dissolves. This is known as sublingual immunotherapy. Sublingual medicines placed under the tongue are used to treat some pollen allergies.

- Emergency epinephrine.If you have a severe allergy, you might need to carry an emergency epinephrine shot at all times. An epinephrine shot (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others) can ease symptoms of a severe allergic reaction until you get emergency treatment.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Some allergy symptoms get better with steps that you can take at home:
- Sinus congestion and hay fever symptoms.These often get better with saline nasal sprays. These sprays rinse out the sinuses with a salt and water solution. You can use a neti pot or a specially designed squeeze bottle to flush out thickened mucus and irritants from your nose. But be aware that using a neti pot or other device wrong can lead to infection.
- Household airborne allergy symptoms.Lessen your exposure to dust mites or pet dander by washing bedding and stuffed toys in hot water often. Also, keep the indoor humidity level low. And regularly using a vacuum with a fine filter such as a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Think about replace carpeting with hard flooring too.
- Mold allergy symptoms.Reduce moisture in damp areas, such as your bath and kitchen, by using ventilation fans and dehumidifiers. Fix leaks inside and outside your home. You also can improve airflow by leaving doors between rooms open and moving furniture away from walls.

## Alternative medicine
Research suggests that a type of alternative medicine called acupuncture may help ease some hay fever symptoms. With acupuncture, a practitioner places very thin needles through the skin at specific points on the body.

## Preparing for your appointment
For symptoms that could be caused by an allergy, see your main healthcare professional. You might be referred to a doctor called an allergist who treats allergies.

## What you can do
Ask if you should stop taking allergy medicines before your appointment, and for how long. For example, antihistamines can affect the results of an allergy skin test.
Make a list of:
- Your symptoms,including any that don't seem related to allergies. Note when the symptoms began.
- Your family's historyof allergies and asthma, including specific types of allergies, if you know them.
- All medicines,vitamins and other supplements you take, including doses.
- Questions to askyour healthcare professional.
Some basic questions to ask your healthcare professional include:
- What is the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- Are there other possible causes?
- Will I need allergy tests?
- Should I see an allergy specialist?
- What treatment do you recommend?
- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- What emergency symptoms should my friends and family be aware of?
Feel free to ask other questions.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your healthcare professional is likely to ask you questions such as:
- Have you recently had a cold or other respiratory infection?
- Are your symptoms worse at certain times of the day?
- Does anything seem to improve or worsen your symptoms?
- Are your symptoms worse in certain areas of your home or at work?
- Do you have pets, and do they go into bedrooms?
- Is there dampness or water damage in your home or workplace?
- Do you smoke, or are you exposed to secondhand smoke or other pollutants?
- What treatments have you tried so far? Have they helped?

DISEASE NAME: GASTRITIS


## Overview
Gastritis is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common: Inflammation of the lining of the stomach. The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers or the regular use of certain pain relievers. Drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis.
Gastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis) or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis). In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer. For most people, however, gastritis isn't serious and improves quickly with treatment.

## Symptoms
Gastritis doesn't always cause symptoms. When it does, the symptoms of gastritis may include:
- Gnawing or burning ache or pain, called indigestion, in your upper belly. This feeling may become either worse or better after eating.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating.

## When to see a doctor
Nearly everyone has had indigestion and stomach irritation at some point. Usually, indigestion doesn't last long and doesn't require medical care. See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of gastritis for a week or longer.
Seek medical attention right away if you have severe pain or if you have vomiting where you cannot hold any food down. Also seek attention right away if you feel lightheaded or dizzy. Tell your healthcare professional if your stomach discomfort happens after taking medicines, especially aspirin or other pain relievers.
If you are vomiting blood, have blood in your stools or have stools that appear black, see your healthcare professional right away to find the cause.

## Causes
Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining. The stomach lining is a mucus-lined barrier that protects the stomach wall. Weaknesses or injury to the barrier allows digestive juices to damage and inflame the stomach lining. Several diseases and conditions can increase the risk of gastritis. These include inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease.

## Risk factors
Factors that increase your risk of gastritis include:
- Bacterial infection.A bacterial infection called Helicobacter pylori, also known as H. pylori, is one of the most common worldwide human infections. However, only some people with the infection develop gastritis or other upper gastrointestinal disorders. Healthcare professionals believe sensitivity to the germs could be inherited. Sensitivity also may be caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking and diet.
- Regular use of pain relievers.Pain relievers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, can cause both acute gastritis and chronic gastritis. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS). Using these pain relievers regularly or taking too much of these medicines may damage the stomach lining.
- Older age.Older adults have an increased risk of gastritis because the stomach lining tends to thin with age. Older adults also have an increased risk because they are more likely to have H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders than younger people are.
- Excessive alcohol use.Alcohol can irritate and break down your stomach lining. This makes your stomach more vulnerable to digestive juices. Excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute gastritis.
- Stress.Severe stress due to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis.
- Cancer treatment.Chemotherapy medicines or radiation treatment can increase your risk of gastritis.
- Your own body attacking cells in your stomach.Called autoimmune gastritis, this type of gastritis occurs when your body attacks the cells that make up your stomach lining. This reaction can wear away at your stomach's protective barrier.Autoimmune gastritis is more common in people with other autoimmune disorders. These include Hashimoto's disease and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune gastritis also can be associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency.

- Other diseases and conditions.Gastritis may be associated with other medical conditions. These may include HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, sarcoidosis and parasitic infections.

## Complications
Left untreated, gastritis may lead to stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding. Rarely, some forms of chronic gastritis may increase your risk of stomach cancer. This risk is increased if you have extensive thinning of the stomach lining and changes in the lining's cells.
Tell your healthcare professional if your symptoms aren't improving despite treatment for gastritis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: GASTRITIS


## Diagnosis
Your healthcare professional is likely to suspect gastritis after talking to you about your medical history and performing an exam. However, you also may have one or more of the following tests to find the exact cause.
- Tests for H. pylori.Your healthcare professional may recommend tests such as a stool test or breath test to determine whether you have H. pylori. Which type of test you have depends on your situation.For the breath test, you drink a small glass of clear, tasteless liquid that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori germs break down the test liquid in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you're infected with H. pylori, your breath sample will contain the radioactive carbon.

Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you're infected with H. pylori, your breath sample will contain the radioactive carbon.
- Passing a thin, flexible scope down the throat, called an endoscopy.Endoscopy is a procedure to examine the digestive system with a long, thin tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope. The endoscope passes down the throat, into the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. Using the endoscope, your healthcare professional looks for signs of inflammation. Depending on your age and medical history, your healthcare professional may recommend this as a first test instead of testing for H. pylori.If a suspicious area is found, your healthcare professional may remove small tissue samples, called a biopsy, to test in a lab. A biopsy also can identify the presence of H. pylori in your stomach lining.

- X-ray of your upper digestive system.X-rays can create images of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine to look for anything unusual. You may have to swallow a white, metallic liquid that contains barium. The liquid coats your digestive tract and makes an ulcer more visible. This procedure is called a barium swallow.

## Treatment
Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause. Acute gastritis caused by NSAIDs or alcohol may be relieved by stopping use of those substances.
Medicines used to treat gastritis include:
- Antibiotics to kill H. pylori.For H. pylori in your digestive tract, your healthcare professional may recommend a combination of antibiotics to kill the germs. Be sure to take the full antibiotic prescription, usually for 7 to 14 days. You also may take a medicine to block acid production. Once treated, your healthcare professional will retest you for H. pylori to be sure it has been destroyed.
- Medicines that block acid production and promote healing.Medicines called proton pump inhibitors help reduce acid. They do this by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. You may get a prescription for proton pump inhibitors, or you can buy them without a prescription.Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures. Ask your healthcare professional whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk.

- Medicines to reduce acid production.Acid blockers, also called histamine blockers, reduce the amount of acid released into your digestive tract. Reducing acid relieves gastritis pain and encourages healing. You may get a prescription for an acid blocker, or you can buy one without a prescription.
- Medicines that neutralize stomach acid.Your healthcare professional may include an antacid in your treatment. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. These help with immediate symptom relief but are generally not used as a primary treatment. Side effects of antacids can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients. Proton pump inhibitors and acid blockers are more effective and have fewer side effects.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
You may find some relief from symptoms if you:
- Don't drink alcohol.Alcohol can irritate the mucous lining of your stomach.
- Consider switching pain relievers.If you use pain relievers that increase your risk of gastritis, ask your healthcare professional whether acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may be an option for you. This medicine is less likely to stir up your stomach problem.

## Preparing for your appointment
Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.
If your healthcare professional thinks that you might have gastritis, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in digestive disorders, called a gastroenterologist.
Because appointments can be brief, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready.

## What you can do
- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.
- Write down symptoms you're experiencing,including any that may not seem related to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
- Write down key personal information,including major stresses or recent life changes.
- Make a list of all medicines,vitamins or supplements you're taking and the doses.
- Take a family member or friend along.Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
- Write down questions to askyour healthcare team.
Your time with your healthcare team is limited, so preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For gastritis, some basic questions to ask include:
- What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?
- Should I be tested for H. pylori, or do I need an endoscopy?
- Could any of my medicines be causing my condition?
- What are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
- What is the best course of action?
- What are alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?
- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there restrictions that I need to follow?
- Should I see a specialist?
- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
- Are there brochures or other printed material I can take? What websites do you recommend?
- What will determine whether I should schedule a follow-up visit?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

## What to expect from your doctor
Be prepared to answer questions, such as:
- What are your symptoms?
- How severe are your symptoms? Would you describe your stomach pain as mildly uncomfortable or burning?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- Does anything, such as eating certain foods, seem to worsen your symptoms?
- Does anything, such as eating certain foods or taking antacids, seem to improve your symptoms?
- Do you experience any nausea or vomiting?
- Have you recently lost weight?
- How often do you take pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen sodium?
- How often do you drink alcohol, and how much do you drink?
- How would you rate your stress level?
- Have you noticed any black stools or blood in your stool?
- Have you ever had an ulcer?

## What you can do in the meantime
Before your appointment, avoid drinking alcohol and eating foods that seem to irritate your stomach. These foods may include those that are spicy, acidic, fried or fatty. But talk to your healthcare professional before stopping any prescription medicines you're taking.

DISEASE NAME: DIARRHEA


## Overview
Diarrhea — loose, watery and possibly more-frequent passage of stool — is a common problem. Sometimes, it's the only symptom of a condition. At other times, it may be associated with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or weight loss.
Luckily, diarrhea is usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days. But when diarrhea lasts beyond a few days, it is usually a clue to another problem — such as medicine side effects, changes in diet, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or a more serious disorder, including ongoing infection, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

## Symptoms
Symptoms associated with loose, watery stools, also called diarrhea, may include:
- Belly cramps or pain.
- Bloating.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Fever.
- Blood in the stool.
- Mucus in the stool.
- Urgent need to pass stool.

## When to see a doctor
If you're an adult, see your doctor if:
- Your diarrhea doesn't get better or stop after two days.
- You become dehydrated.
- You have terrible abdominal or rectal pain.
- You have bloody or black stools.
- You have a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
In children, particularly young children, diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration. Call your doctor if your child's diarrhea doesn't improve within 24 hours or if your child:
- Becomes dehydrated.
- Has a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
- Has bloody or black stools.

## Causes
A number of diseases and conditions can cause diarrhea, including:
- Viruses.Viruses that can cause diarrhea include Norwalk virus, also known as norovirus, enteric adenoviruses, astrovirus, cytomegalovirus and viruses that cause hepatitis. Rotavirus is a common cause of sudden childhood diarrhea. The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also has been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
- Bacteria and parasites.Exposure to certain bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, or parasites through contaminated food or water can lead to diarrhea. When traveling in developing countries, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is often called traveler's diarrhea. Clostridioides difficile, also known as C. diff, is another bacterium that causes diarrhea, and it can occur after a course of antibiotics or during a hospital stay.
- Medicines.Many medicines, such as antibiotics, can cause diarrhea. Antibiotics get rid of infections by killing bacteria that cause illness, but they also kill good bacteria that are helpful in the body. This disturbs the natural balance of bacteria in the intestines, leading to diarrhea or an infection such as C. diff. Other medicines that cause diarrhea are anticancer drugs and antacids with magnesium.
- Lactose intolerance.Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. People who have trouble digesting lactose often have diarrhea after eating dairy products. Lactose intolerance can increase with age because levels of the enzyme that helps digest lactose become lower as people get older.
- Fructose.Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits and honey. It's sometimes added as a sweetener to certain beverages. Fructose can lead to diarrhea in people who have trouble digesting it.
- Artificial sweeteners.Sorbitol, erythritol and mannitol — nonabsorbable sugars used as artificial sweeteners in chewing gum and other sugar-free products — can cause diarrhea in some otherwise healthy people.
- Surgery.Partial intestine or gallbladder removal surgeries can sometimes cause diarrhea.
- Other digestive disorders.Chronic diarrhea has a number of other causes, such as IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, microscopic colitis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

## Risk factors
Some common risk factors for diarrhea include:
- Exposure to viruses, bacteria or parasites.This is a major risk factor for sudden onset of diarrhea.
- Diet.Certain foods or drinks, including coffee, tea, dairy products, or foods containing artificial sweeteners can cause diarrhea in some people.
- Medicines.Some medicines, such as antibiotics, laxatives, magnesium supplements, antidepressants, NSAIDs, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, can cause diarrhea.

## Complications
Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which can be life-threatening if not treated. Dehydration is particularly dangerous in children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems.
If you have symptoms of serious dehydration, seek medical help.

## Symptoms of dehydration in adults
These include:
- Excessive thirst.
- Dry mouth or skin.
- Little or no urination.
- Weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness.
- Fatigue.
- Dark-colored urine.

## Symptoms of dehydration in infants and young children
These include:
- Not having a wet diaper in three or more hours.
- Dry mouth and tongue.
- Fever above 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).
- Crying without tears.
- Drowsiness, unresponsiveness or irritability.
- Sunken appearance to the belly, eyes or cheeks.

## Prevention

## Preventing infectious diarrhea
Wash your hands to prevent the spread of infectious diarrhea. To ensure adequate hand-washing:
- Wash frequently.Wash your hands before and after preparing food. And wash your hands after handling uncooked meat, using the toilet, changing diapers, sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose.
- Lather with soap for at least 20 seconds.After putting soap on your hands, rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds. This is about as long as it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" two times.
- Use hand sanitizer when washing isn't possible.Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you can't get to a sink. Apply the hand sanitizer as you would hand lotion, making sure to cover the front and back of both hands. Use a product that contains at least 60% alcohol.

## Vaccination
You can help protect your infant from rotavirus, the most common cause of viral diarrhea in children, with one of two approved vaccines. Ask your baby's doctor about having your baby vaccinated.

## Preventing traveler's diarrhea
Diarrhea commonly affects people who travel to countries with poor sanitation and contaminated food. To reduce your risk:
- Watch what you eat.Eat hot, well-cooked foods. Don't eat raw fruits and vegetables unless you can peel them yourself. Don't eat raw or undercooked meats and dairy foods.
- Watch what you drink.Drink bottled water, soda, beer or wine served in its original container. Don't drink tap water or use ice cubes. Use bottled water even for brushing your teeth. Keep your mouth closed while you shower.Beverages made with boiled water, such as coffee and tea, are probably safe. Remember that alcohol and caffeine can aggravate diarrhea and worsen dehydration.

- Ask your health care team about antibiotics.If you're traveling to a developing country for an extended time, ask a member of your healthcare team about getting antibiotics before you go, especially if you have a weakened immune system.
- Check for travel warnings.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains a travelers' health website where disease warnings are posted for various countries. If you're planning to travel outside of the United States, check there for warnings and tips for reducing your risk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: DIARRHEA


## Diagnosis
Your healthcare professional will likely ask about your medical history, review the medicines you take and conduct a physical exam. Your health professional may order tests to determine what's causing your diarrhea. Possible tests include:
- Blood tests.A complete blood count, measurement of electrolytes and tests of kidney function can help indicate how bad your diarrhea is.
- Stool test.You may have a stool test to see if a bacterium or parasite is causing your diarrhea.
- Hydrogen breath test.This type of test can help determine if you have a lactose intolerance. After you drink a liquid that contains high levels of lactose, your breath is measured for hydrogen at regular intervals. Breathing out too much hydrogen indicates that you aren't fully digesting and absorbing lactose.
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.Using a thin, lighted tube that's inserted into the rectum, a medical professional can see inside of the colon. The device also has a tool that allows the doctor to take a small sample of tissue, called a biopsy, from the colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy provides a view of the lower colon, while colonoscopy allows the doctor to see the entire colon.
- Upper endoscopy.A medical professional uses a long, thin tube with a camera on the end to examine the stomach and upper small intestine. They may remove a tissue sample to be checked in a laboratory.

## Treatment
Most cases of sudden diarrhea clear on their own within a couple of days without treatment. If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your healthcare professional might recommend medicines or other treatments.

## Antibiotics or antiparasitics
Antibiotics or antiparasitic medicines might help treat diarrhea caused by certain bacteria or parasites. Most bacterial causes of diarrhea do not need treatment in most people. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help.

## Treatment to replace fluids
Your healthcare professional likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts that you lose when you have diarrhea. For most adults, that means drinking water with electrolytes, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes vomiting, your healthcare professional might give you IV fluids.
Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes — minerals such as sodium and potassium — that your body needs to function. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. But certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse.
For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids.

## Adjusting medicines you're taking
If your healthcare professional determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, you might be given a lower dose or a different medicine.

## Treating underlying conditions
If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your healthcare professional works to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Diarrhea usually clears up quickly without treatment. To help you cope with your symptoms until the diarrhea goes away, try to do the following:
- Drink plenty of liquids,including water, broths and juices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
- Add semisolid and low-fiber foods graduallyas your stool returns to what's typical for you. Try soda crackers, toast, eggs, rice or chicken.
- Don't eat certain foodssuch as dairy products, fatty foods, high-fiber foods or highly seasoned foods for a few days.
- Ask about antidiarrheal medicines.Nonprescription antidiarrheal medicines, such as loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate, might help reduce how often you pass watery stool and control severe symptoms.Certain medical conditions and infections — bacterial and parasitic — can be worsened by these medicines because they prevent your body from getting rid of what's causing the diarrhea. Some of these medicines are not recommended for children. Check with your healthcare professional before taking these medicines or giving them to a child.

- Take probiotics.These microorganisms may help restore a healthy balance to the intestinal tract by boosting the level of good bacteria. However, it's not clear if they can help shorten a bout of diarrhea. Probiotics are available in capsule or liquid form and are also added to some foods, such as certain brands of yogurt. Further research is needed to better understand which strains of bacteria are most helpful and what doses are needed.

You might start by seeing a member of your primary healthcare team. If you have lasting diarrhea, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in the digestive system, called a gastroenterologist.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as fast before certain tests. Make a list of:
- Your symptoms,including when they began and any that may seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment.
- Key personal information,including any major stresses, recent life changes or travel.
- Medicines, vitamins or supplements you take,including doses. If you've recently taken an antibiotic, note what kind, for how long and when you stopped.
- Questions to askyour healthcare professional.
For diarrhea, some basic questions to ask include:
- What is likely causing my diarrhea?
- Could my diarrhea be caused by a medicine I'm taking?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my diarrhea likely short-term or long lasting?
- What is the best course of action?
- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them with the diarrhea?
- Are there restrictions I should follow?
- May I take medicine such as loperamide to slow down the diarrhea?
- Should I see a specialist?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your healthcare professional is likely to ask you questions, including:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Do your symptoms happen all the time or only sometimes?
- How bad are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to make your symptoms better?
- What, if anything, appears to make your symptoms worse?
- Does your diarrhea awaken you at night?
- Do you see blood in your stool, or are your stools black?
- Have you recently been around anyone who has diarrhea?
- Have you recently stayed in a hospital or nursing home?
- Have you taken antibiotics recently?

## What you can do in the meantime
While you wait for your appointment, you may ease your symptoms if you:
- Drink more fluids.To help avoid dehydration, drink water, juice and broth.
- Don't eat foods that can aggravate diarrhea.Stay away from fatty, high-fiber or highly seasoned foods.

DISEASE NAME: TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA


## Overview
Traveler's diarrhea is a digestive tract disorder that commonly causes loose stools and stomach cramps. It's caused by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Fortunately, traveler's diarrhea usually isn't serious in most people — it's just unpleasant.
When you visit a place where the climate or sanitary practices are different from yours at home, you have an increased risk of developing traveler's diarrhea.
To reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea, be careful about what you eat and drink while traveling. If you do develop traveler's diarrhea, chances are it will go away without treatment. However, it's a good idea to have doctor-approved medicines with you when you travel to high-risk areas. This way, you'll be prepared in case diarrhea gets severe or won't go away.

## Symptoms
Traveler's diarrhea may begin suddenly during your trip or shortly after you return home. Most people improve within 1 to 2 days without treatment and recover completely within a week. However, you can have multiple episodes of traveler's diarrhea during one trip.
The most common symptoms of traveler's diarrhea are:
- Suddenly passing three or more looser watery stools a day.
- An urgent need to pass stool.
- Stomach cramps.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Fever.
Sometimes, people experience moderate to severe dehydration, ongoing vomiting, a high fever, bloody stools, or severe pain in the belly or rectum. If you or your child experiences any of these symptoms or if the diarrhea lasts longer than a few days, it's time to see a healthcare professional.

## When to see a doctor
Traveler's diarrhea usually goes away on its own within several days. Symptoms may last longer and be more severe if it's caused by certain bacteria or parasites. In such cases, you may need prescription medicines to help you get better.
If you're an adult, see your doctor if:
- Your diarrhea lasts beyond two days.
- You become dehydrated.
- You have severe stomach or rectal pain.
- You have bloody or black stools.
- You have a fever above 102 F (39 C).
While traveling internationally, a local embassy or consulate may be able to help you find a well-regarded medical professional who speaks your language.
Be especially cautious with children because traveler's diarrhea can cause severe dehydration in a short time. Call a doctor if your child is sick and has any of the following symptoms:
- Ongoing vomiting.
- A fever of 102 F (39 C) or more.
- Bloody stools or severe diarrhea.
- Dry mouth or crying without tears.
- Signs of being unusually sleepy, drowsy or unresponsive.
- Decreased volume of urine, including fewer wet diapers in infants.

## Causes
It's possible that traveler's diarrhea may stem from the stress of traveling or a change in diet. But usually infectious agents — such as bacteria, viruses or parasites — are to blame. You typically develop traveler's diarrhea after ingesting food or water contaminated with organisms from feces.
So why aren't natives of high-risk countries affected in the same way? Often their bodies have become used to the bacteria and have developed immunity to them.

## Risk factors
Each year millions of international travelers experience traveler's diarrhea. High-risk destinations for traveler's diarrhea include areas of:
- Central America.
- South America.
- Mexico.
- Africa.
- South Asia and Southeast Asia.
Traveling to Eastern Europe, South Africa, Central and East Asia, the Middle East, and a few Caribbean islands also poses some risk. However, your risk of traveler's diarrhea is generally low in Northern and Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
Your chances of getting traveler's diarrhea are mostly determined by your destination. But certain groups of people have a greater risk of developing the condition. These include:
- Young adults.The condition is slightly more common in young adult tourists. Though the reasons why aren't clear, it's possible that young adults lack acquired immunity. They may also be more adventurous than older people in their travels and dietary choices, or they may be less careful about avoiding contaminated foods.
- People with weakened immune systems.A weakened immune system due to an underlying illness or immune-suppressing medicines such as corticosteroids increases risk of infections.
- People with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, or severe kidney, liver or heart disease.These conditions can leave you more prone to infection or increase your risk of a more-severe infection.
- People who take acid blockers or antacids.Acid in the stomach tends to destroy organisms, so a reduction in stomach acid may leave more opportunity for bacterial survival.
- People who travel during certain seasons.The risk of traveler's diarrhea varies by season in certain parts of the world. For example, risk is highest in South Asia during the hot months just before the monsoons.

## Complications
Because you lose vital fluids, salts and minerals during a bout with traveler's diarrhea, you may become dehydrated, especially during the summer months. Dehydration is especially dangerous for children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
Dehydration caused by diarrhea can cause serious complications, including organ damage, shock or coma. Symptoms of dehydration include a very dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, dizziness, or extreme weakness.

## Prevention

## Watch what you eat
The general rule of thumb when traveling to another country is this: Boil it, cook it, peel it or forget it. But it's still possible to get sick even if you follow these rules.
Other tips that may help decrease your risk of getting sick include:
- Don't consume food from street vendors.
- Don't consume unpasteurized milk and dairy products, including ice cream.
- Don't eat raw or undercooked meat, fish and shellfish.
- Don't eat moist food at room temperature, such as sauces and buffet offerings.
- Eat foods that are well cooked and served hot.
- Stick to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself, such as bananas, oranges and avocados. Stay away from salads and from fruits you can't peel, such as grapes and berries.
- Be aware that alcohol in a drink won't keep you safe from contaminated water or ice.

## Don't drink the water
When visiting high-risk areas, keep the following tips in mind:
- Don't drink unsterilized water — from tap, well or stream. If you need to consume local water, boil it for three minutes. Let the water cool naturally and store it in a clean covered container.
- Don't use locally made ice cubes or drink mixed fruit juices made with tap water.
- Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in contaminated water.
- Use bottled or boiled water to mix baby formula.
- Order hot beverages, such as coffee or tea, and make sure they're steaming hot.
- Feel free to drink canned or bottled drinks in their original containers — including water, carbonated beverages, beer or wine — as long as you break the seals on the containers yourself. Wipe off any can or bottle before drinking or pouring.
- Use bottled water to brush your teeth.
- Don't swim in water that may be contaminated.
- Keep your mouth closed while showering.
If it's not possible to buy bottled water or boil your water, bring some means to purify water. Consider a water-filter pump with a microstrainer filter that can filter out small microorganisms.
You also can chemically disinfect water with iodine or chlorine. Iodine tends to be more effective, but is best reserved for short trips, as too much iodine can be harmful to your system. You can purchase water-disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, iodine tablets or crystals, or other disinfecting agents at camping stores and pharmacies. Be sure to follow the directions on the package.

## Follow additional tips
Here are other ways to reduce your risk of traveler's diarrhea:
- Make sure dishes and utensils are clean and dry before using them.
- Wash your hands often and always before eating. If washing isn't possible, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands before eating.
- Seek out food items that require little handling in preparation.
- Keep children from putting things — including their dirty hands — in their mouths. If possible, keep infants from crawling on dirty floors.
- Tie a colored ribbon around the bathroom faucet to remind you not to drink — or brush your teeth with — tap water.

## Other preventive measures
Public health experts generally don't recommend taking antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, because doing so can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Antibiotics provide no protection against viruses and parasites, but they can give travelers a false sense of security about the risks of consuming local foods and beverages. They also can cause unpleasant side effects, such as skin rashes, skin reactions to the sun and vaginal yeast infections.
As a preventive measure, some doctors suggest taking bismuth subsalicylate, which has been shown to decrease the likelihood of diarrhea. However, don't take this medicine for longer than three weeks, and don't take it at all if you're pregnant or allergic to aspirin. Talk to your doctor before taking bismuth subsalicylate if you're taking certain medicines, such as anticoagulants.
Common harmless side effects of bismuth subsalicylate include a black-colored tongue and dark stools. In some cases, it can cause constipation, nausea and, rarely, ringing in your ears, called tinnitus.

DISEASE NAME: TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA


## Diagnosis
Diagnosing traveler's diarrhea typically involves taking a medical and travel history. A physical exam may be done to check for signs of dehydration. If symptoms are serious or don't resolve on their own, a stool sample may be done to check for microorganisms.

## Treatment
Traveler's diarrhea may get better without any treatment. But while you're waiting, it's important to try to stay hydrated with safe liquids, such as bottled water or water with electrolytes such as an oral rehydration solution (see below). If you don't seem to be improving quickly, several medicines are available to help relieve symptoms.
- Anti-motility agents.These medicines — which include loperamide and drugs containing diphenoxylate — provide prompt but temporary relief by:Reducing muscle spasms in your gastrointestinal tract.Slowing the transit time through your digestive system.Allowing more time for absorption.Anti-motility medicines aren't recommended for infants or people with a fever or bloody diarrhea. This is because they can delay clearance of the infectious organisms and make the illness worse.Also, stop using anti-motility agents after 48 hours if you have stomach pain or if your symptoms worsen and your diarrhea continues. In such cases, see a doctor. You may need blood or stool tests and treatment with an antibiotic.

- Bismuth subsalicylate.This nonprescription medicine can decrease the frequency of your stools and shorten the length of your illness. However, it isn't recommended for children, pregnant women or people who are allergic to aspirin.
- Antibiotics.If you have more than four loose stools a day or severe symptoms, including a fever or blood, pus or mucus in your stools, a doctor may prescribe a course of antibiotics.
Before you leave for your trip, talk to your doctor about taking a prescription with you in case you get a serious bout of traveler's diarrhea.

## Avoiding dehydration
Dehydration is the most likely complication of traveler's diarrhea, so it's important to try to stay well hydrated.
An oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution is the best way to replace lost fluids. These solutions contain water and salts in specific proportions to replenish both fluids and electrolytes. They also contain glucose to enhance absorption in the intestinal tract.
Bottled oral rehydration products are available in drugstores in developed areas, and many pharmacies carry their own brands. You can find packets of powdered oral rehydration salts, labeled World Health Organization (WHO)-ORS, at stores, pharmacies and health agencies in most countries. Reconstitute the powder in bottled or boiled water according to the directions on the package.
If these products are unavailable, you can prepare your own rehydrating solution in an emergency by mixing together:
- 3/4 teaspoon table salt.
- 2 tablespoons sugar.
- 1 quart uncontaminated bottled or boiled water.
- Sugar-free flavor powder, such as Crystal Light (optional).
You or your child can drink the solution in small amounts throughout the day as a supplement to solid foods or formula, as long as dehydration persists. Small amounts reduce the likelihood of vomiting. Breastfed infants also can drink the solution but should continue nursing on demand.
If dehydration symptoms — such as dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, dizziness, or extreme weakness — don't improve, seek medical care right away. Oral rehydration solutions are intended only for urgent short-term use.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
If you do get traveler's diarrhea, avoid caffeine, alcohol and dairy products, which may worsen symptoms or increase fluid loss. But keep drinking fluids.
Drink canned fruit juices, weak tea, clear soup, decaffeinated soda or sports drinks to replace lost fluids and minerals. Later, as your diarrhea improves, try a diet of easy-to-eat complex carbohydrates, such as salted crackers, bland cereals, bananas, applesauce, dry toast or bread, rice, potatoes, and plain noodles.
You may return to your normal diet as you feel you can tolerate it. Add dairy products, caffeinated beverages and high-fiber foods cautiously.

## Preparing for your appointment
Call a doctor if you have diarrhea that is severe, lasts more than a few days or is bloody. If you are traveling, call an embassy or consulate for help locating a doctor. Other signs that you should seek medical attention include:
- A fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher.
- Ongoing vomiting.
- Signs of severe dehydration, including a dry mouth, muscle cramps, decreased urine output, dizziness or fatigue.
If you have diarrhea and you've just returned home from a trip abroad, share that trip information with your doctor when you call to make an appointment.
Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect.

## Information to gather in advance
- Pre-appointment instructions.At the time you make your appointment, ask whether there are immediate self-care steps you can take to help recover more quickly.
- Symptom history.Write down any symptoms you've been experiencing and for how long.
- Medical history.Make a list of your key medical information, including other conditions for which you're being treated and any medicines, vitamins or supplements you're currently taking.
- Questions to ask your healthcare professional.Write down your questions in advance so that you can make the most of your time.
The list below suggests questions to ask about traveler's diarrhea.
- What's causing my symptoms?
- Are there any other possible causes for my symptoms?
- What kinds of tests do I need?
- What treatment approach do you recommend?
- Are there any possible side effects from the medicines I'll be taking?
- Will my diarrhea or its treatment affect the other health conditions I have? How can I best manage these conditions together?
- What is the safest way for me to rehydrate?
- Do I need to follow any dietary restrictions and for how long?
- How soon after I begin treatment will I start to feel better?
- How long do you expect a full recovery to take?
- Am I contagious? How can I reduce my risk of passing my illness to others?
- What can I do to reduce my risk of this condition in the future?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared, don't hesitate to ask questions as they occur to you during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over points you want to talk about in-depth. Your doctor may ask:
- What are your symptoms?
- When did you first begin experiencing symptoms?
- Have you traveled recently?
- Where did you travel?
- Have you taken any antibiotics recently?
- Have your symptoms been getting better or worse?
- Have you noticed any blood in your stools?
- Have you experienced symptoms of dehydration, such as muscle cramps or fatigue?
- What treatments have you tried so far, if any?
- Have you been able to keep down any food or liquid?
- Are you pregnant?
- Are you being treated for any other medical conditions?

DISEASE NAME: FOOD POISONING


## Overview
Food poisoning, a type of foodborne illness, is a sickness people get from something they ate or drank. The causes are germs or other harmful things in the food or beverage.
Symptoms of food poisoning often include upset stomach, diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually start within hours or several days of eating the food. Most people have mild illness and get better without treatment.
Sometimes food poisoning causes severe illness or complications.

## Symptoms
Symptoms vary depending on what is causing the illness. They may begin within a few hours or a few weeks depending on the cause.
Common symptoms are:
- Upset stomach.
- Vomiting.
- Diarrhea.
- Diarrhea with bloody stools.
- Stomach pain and cramps.
- Fever.
- Headache.
Less often food poisoning affects the nervous system and can cause severe disease. Symptoms may include:
- Blurred or double vision.
- Headache.
- Loss of movement in limbs.
- Problems with swallowing.
- Tingling or numbness of skin.
- Weakness.
- Changes in sound of the voice.

## When to see a doctor
Vomiting and diarrhea can quickly cause low levels of body fluids, also called dehydration, in infants and children. This can cause serious illness in infants.
Call your child's health care provider if your child's symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea and any of the following:
- Unusual changes in behavior or thinking.
- Excessive thirst.
- Little or no urination.
- Weakness.
- Dizziness.
- Diarrhea that lasts more than a day.
- Vomiting often.
- Stools that have blood or pus.
- Stools that are black or tarry.
- Severe pain in the stomach or rectum.
- Any fever in children under 2 years of age.
- Fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius) or higher in older children.
- History of other medical problems.
Adults should see a health care provider or get emergency care if the following occur:
- Nervous system symptoms, such as blurry vision, muscle weakness and tingling of skin.
- Changes in thinking or behavior.
- Fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius).
- Vomiting often.
- Diarrhea that lasts more than three days.
- Symptoms of dehydration — excessive thirst, dry mouth, little or no urination, severe weakness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.

## Causes
Many germs or harmful things, called contaminants, can cause foodborne illnesses. Food or drink that carries a contaminant is called "contaminated." Food can be contaminated with any of the following:
- Bacteria.
- Viruses.
- Parasites that can live in the intestines.
- Poisons, also called toxins.
- Bacteria that carry or make toxins.
- Molds that make toxins.

## Understanding terms
The term "food poisoning" is commonly used to describe all foodborne illnesses. A health care provider might use these terms to be more specific:
- "Foodborne illnesses" means all illnesses from any contaminated food or beverage.
- "Food poisoning" means illness specifically from a toxin in food. Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness.

## How food becomes contaminated
Food can be contaminated at any point from the farm or fishery to the table. The problem can begin during growing, harvesting or catching, processing, storing, shipping, or preparing.
Food can be contaminated any place it's handled, including the home, because of:
- Poor handwashing.Feces that remains on the hands after using the toilet can contaminate food. Other contaminants can be transferred from hands during food preparation or food serving.
- Not disinfecting cooking or eating areas.Unwashed knives, cutting boards or other kitchen tools can spread contaminants.
- Improper storage.Food left out for too long at room temperature can become contaminated. Food stored in the refrigerator for too long can spoil. Also, food stored in a refrigerator or freezer that is too warm can spoil.

## Common causes
The following table shows common causes of foodborne illnesses, the time from exposure to the beginning of symptoms and common sources of contamination.

## Other sources
Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses can also be found in swimming pools, lakes, ponds, rivers and seawater. Also, some bacteria, such as E. coli, may be spread by exposure to animals carrying the disease.

## Risk factors
Anyone can get food poisoning. Some people are more likely to get sick or have more-serious disease or complications. These people include:
- Infants and children.
- Pregnant people.
- Older adults.
- People with weakened immune systems due to another disease or treatments.

## Complications
In most healthy adults, complications are uncommon. They can include the following.

## Dehydration
The most common complication is dehydration. This a severe loss of water and salts and minerals. Both vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration.
Most healthy adults can drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. Children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems or other illnesses may not be able to replace the fluids they've lost. They are more likely to become dehydrated.
People who become dehydrated may need to get fluids directly into the bloodstream at the hospital. Severe dehydration can cause organ damage, other severe disease and death if not treated.

## Complications of systemic disease
Some contaminants can cause more widespread disease in the body, also called systemic disease or infection. This is more common in people who are older, have weakened immune systems or other medical conditions. Systemic infections from foodborne bacteria may cause:
- Blood clots in the kidneys.E. coli can result in blood clots that block the kidneys' filtering system. This condition, called hemolytic uremic syndrome, results in the sudden failure of the kidneys to filter waste from the blood. Less often, other bacteria or viruses may cause this condition.
- Bacteria in the bloodstream.Bacteria in the blood can cause disease in the blood itself or spread disease to other parts of the body.
- Meningitis.Meningitis is inflammation that may damage the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
- Sepsis.Sepsis is an overreaction of the immune system to systemic disease that damages the body's own tissues.

## Pregnancy complications
Illness from the listeria bacteria during pregnancy can result in:
- Miscarriage or stillbirth.
- Sepsis in the newborn.
- Meningitis in the newborn.

## Rare complications
Rare complications include conditions that may develop after food poisoning, including:
- Arthritis.Arthritis is swelling, tenderness or pain in joints.
- Irritable bowel syndrome.Irritable bowel syndrome is a lifelong condition of the intestines that causes pain, cramping and irregular bowel movements.
- Guillain-Barre syndrome.Guillain-Barre syndrome is an immune system attack on nerves that can result in tingling, numbness and loss of muscle control.
- Breathing difficulties.Rarely, botulism can damage nerves that control the muscles involved in breathing.

## Prevention
To prevent food poisoning at home:
- Handwashing.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Do this after using the toilet, before eating, and before and after handling food.
- Wash fruits and vegetables.Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, peeling or preparing.
- Wash kitchen utensils thoroughly.Wash cutting boards, knives and other utensils with soapy water after contact with raw meats or unwashed fruits and vegetables.
- Don't eat raw or undercooked meat or fish.Use a meat thermometer to make sure meat is cooked enough. Cook whole meats and fish to at least 145 F (63 C) and let rest for at least three minutes. Cook ground meat to at least 160 F (71 C). Cook whole and ground poultry to at least 165 F (74 C).
- Refrigerate or freeze leftovers.Put leftovers in covered containers in the refrigerator right after your meal. Leftovers can be kept for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator. If you don't think you'll eat them within four days, freeze them right away.
- Cook leftovers safely.You can safely thaw frozen food three ways. You can microwave it. You can move it to the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Or you can put the frozen food in a leakproof container and put it in cold water on the counter. Reheat leftovers until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).
- Throw it out when in doubt.If you aren't sure if a food has been prepared, served or stored safely, discard it. Even if it looks and smells fine, it may not be safe to eat.
- Throw out moldy food.Throw out any baked foods with mold. Throw out moldy soft fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, berries or peaches. And throw away any nuts or nut products with mold. You can trim away mold from firm foods with low moisture, such as carrots, bell peppers and hard cheeses. Cut away at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) around the moldy part of the food.
- Clean your refrigerator.Clean the inside of the refrigerator every few months. Make a cleaning solution of 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of baking soda and 1 quart (0.9 liters) of water. Clean visible mold in the refrigerator or on the door seals. Use a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of bleach in 1 quart (0.9 liters) of water.

## Safety for at-risk people
Food poisoning is especially serious during pregnancies and for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. These illnesses may be life-threatening. These individuals should avoid the following foods:
- Raw or undercooked meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish.
- Raw or undercooked eggs or foods that may contain them, such as cookie dough and homemade ice cream.
- Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa, bean, clover and radish sprouts.
- Unpasteurized juices and ciders.
- Unpasteurized milk and milk products.
- Soft cheeses, such as feta, brie and Camembert; blue-veined cheese; and unpasteurized cheese.
- Refrigerated pates and meat spreads.
- Uncooked hot dogs, luncheon meats and deli meats.

DISEASE NAME: FOOD POISONING


## Diagnosis
A diagnosis is based on a physical exam and a review of things that may be causing vomiting, diarrhea or other symptoms. Questions from your health care provider will cover:
- Your symptoms.
- Food or drinks you've had recently.
- Symptoms in people who ate with you.
- Recent changes in the drugs you take.
- Recent travel.
Your health care provider will examine you to rule out other causes of illness and check for signs of dehydration.
Your provider may order tests including:
- Stool sample tests to name the bacteria, viruses, parasites or toxins.
- Blood tests to name a cause of illness, rule out other conditions or identify complications.
When one person or a family gets food poisoning, it's hard to know what food was contaminated. The time from eating the contaminated food to the time of sickness can be hours or days. During that time, you may have had one or several more meals. This makes it difficult to say what food made you sick.
In a large outbreak, public health officials may be able to find the common food all of the people shared.

## Treatment
Treatment for food poisoning depends on how severe your symptoms are and what caused the illness. In most cases, drug treatment isn't necessary.
Treatment may include the following:
- Fluid replacement.Fluids and electrolytes, maintain the balance of fluids in your body. Electrolytes include minerals such as sodium, potassium and calcium. After vomiting or diarrhea, it's important to replace fluids to prevent dehydration. Severe dehydration may require going to the hospital. You may need fluids and electrolytes delivered directly into the bloodstream.
- Antibiotics.If the illness is caused by bacteria, you may be prescribed an antibiotic. Antibiotics are generally for people with severe disease or with a higher risk of complications.
- Antiparasitics.Drugs that target parasites, called antiparasitics, are usually prescribed for parasitic infections.
- Probiotics.Your care provider may recommend probiotics. These are treatments that replace healthy bacteria in the digestive system.

## Drugs for diarrhea or upset stomach
Adults who have diarrhea that isn't bloody and who have no fever may take loperamide (Imodium A-D) to treat diarrhea. They also may take bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate, others) to treat an upset stomach. These nonprescription drugs are not recommended for children.
Ask your doctor about these options.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
For most people, symptoms improve without treatment within 48 hours. To help keep yourself more comfortable and prevent dehydration while you recover, try the following:
- Let your stomach settle.Eat after your stomach is settled and you are hungry again.
- Replace fluids.Replace fluids with water, sports drinks, juice with added water or broths. Children or people at risk for serious illness should drink rehydration fluids (Pedialyte, Enfalyte, others). Talk to your doctor before giving rehydration fluids to infants.
- Ease back into eating.Gradually begin to eat bland, low-fat, easy-to-digest foods, such as soda crackers, toast, gelatin, bananas and rice. Stop eating if you feel sick to your stomach again.
- Avoid certain foods and substances until you're feeling better.These include dairy products, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and fatty or highly seasoned foods.
- Rest.Rest to recover from illness and dehydration.

## Preparing for your appointment
You'll likely see your primary health care provider. In some cases, you may need to see a specialist in infectious diseases.
Be prepared to answer the following questions.
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Have the symptoms been continuous, or do they come and go?
- Have you had bloody diarrhea or stools?
- Have you had black or tarry stools?
- Have you had a fever?
- What have you recently eaten?
- Did anyone who ate the same food have symptoms?
- Have you recently traveled? Where?
- What drugs, dietary supplements or herbal remedies do you take?
- Had you taken antibiotics in the days or weeks before your symptoms started?
- Have you recently changed medications?

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: CONSTIPATION


## Overview
Constipation is a problem with passing stool. Constipation generally means passing fewer than three stools a week or having a difficult time passing stool.
Constipation is fairly common. A lack of dietary fiber, fluids and exercise can cause constipation. But other medical conditions or certain medicines may be the cause.
Constipation is usually treated with changes in diet and exercise or with nonprescription medicines. Constipation may require medicines, changes in medicines or other treatments prescribed by a health care professional.
Long-term constipation, also called chronic constipation, may require treating another disease or condition that can cause or worsen constipation.

## Symptoms
Symptoms of constipation include:
- Fewer than three stools a week.
- Hard, dry or lumpy stools.
- Straining or pain when passing stools.
- A feeling that not all stool has passed.
- A feeling that the rectum is blocked.
- The need to use a finger to pass stool.
Chronic constipation is having two or more of these symptoms for three months or longer.

## When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with your health care professional if you have constipation with any of the following conditions:
- Symptoms that last longer than three weeks.
- Symptoms that make it difficult to do everyday activities.
- Bleeding from your rectum or blood on toilet tissue.
- Blood in your stools or black stools.
- Other unusual changes in the shape or color of stools.
- Stomach pain that doesn't stop.
- Weight loss without trying.

## Causes
Patterns of bowel movements vary from one person to another. The typical range is three times a day to three times a week. So it's important to know what is typical for you.
In general, constipation occurs when stool moves too slowly through the large intestine, also called the colon. If the stool moves slowly, the body absorbs too much water from the stool. The stool can become hard, dry and difficult to pass.

## Lifestyle causes
Slow stool movement may happen when a person does not:
- Drink enough fluids.
- Eat enough dietary fiber.
- Exercise regularly.
- Use the toilet when there's an urge to pass stool.

## Medicines
Constipation may be a side effect of some medicines, particularly opioid pain relievers. Other medicines that may cause constipation include some that treat the following conditions:
- Pain.
- High blood pressure.
- Seizures.
- Depression.
- Disorders of the nervous system.
- Allergies.

## Problems with pelvic floor muscles
The muscles that hold up organs at the bottom of the torso are called the pelvic floor muscles. The ability both to relax these muscles and to bear down are necessary to pass stool from the rectum. Problems with weakness or coordination of these muscles can cause chronic constipation.

## Blockages in the colon or rectum
Damage or changes to tissues in the colon or rectum can block the passage of stool. Also, tumors in the colon, rectum or nearby tissues can cause a blockage.

## Other factors
A number of conditions can affect the work of muscles, nerves or hormones involved in passing stool. Chronic constipation may be linked to any number of things, including:
- Irritable bowel syndrome.
- Diabetes.
- Multiple sclerosis.
- Nerve dysfunction or damage.
- Overactive thyroid, also called hyperthyroidism.
- Parkinson's disease.
- Pregnancy.
Sometimes, the cause of chronic constipation can't be found.

## Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of chronic constipation include:
- Being an older adult
- Being a woman
- Getting little or no physical activity
- Having a mental health condition such as depression or an eating disorder

## Complications
Complications of chronic constipation include:
- Swollen tissues around the anus, also called hemorrhoids.
- Torn tissues of the anus, also called anal fissures.
- Hard stools backed up into the colon, also called fecal impaction.
- Exposed tissues of the rectum that have slipped out of the anal opening, also called rectal prolapse.

## Prevention
The following tips can help you avoid developing constipation.
- Eat lots of high-fiber foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans and whole-grain foods.
- Eat fewer foods with low amounts of fiber such as processed foods, dairy and meats.
- Drink plenty of fluids.
- Stay active and exercise regularly.
- Don't ignore the urge to pass stool.
- Create a regular schedule for passing stool, especially after a meal.

DISEASE NAME: CONSTIPATION


## Diagnosis
In addition to giving you a general physical exam, your health care professional will likely do the following during your appointment:
- Gently press on your abdomen to check for pain, tenderness or irregular lumps.
- Look at the tissue of the anus and the surrounding skin.
- Use a gloved finger to check the condition of the rectum and the muscles of the anus.
You'll also be asked questions about your medical history, diet, exercise habits and stools. For some people, the information from this appointment may be enough for a diagnosis and treatment plan.
For other people, one or more additional tests may be needed to help the health care team understand the nature or cause of constipation.

## Laboratory tests
Your health care professional may send samples of your blood to a lab to test for diseases or conditions that can cause constipation.

## Endoscopy
Your health care professional may order a procedure called an endoscopy. A small tube with a camera is guided into the colon. This can reveal the condition of the colon or the presence of irregular tissues. Before this procedure, you may have a limited diet, use an enema or drink solutions that clean out your colon. There are generally two types of tests:
- A colonoscopy is an exam of the rectum and entire colon.
- A sigmoidoscopy is an exam of the rectum and the lower part of the colon, also called the sigmoid or descending colon.

## Imaging tests
Depending on your symptoms, your health care professional may order X-ray imaging. An X-ray can show where stool is present in the colon and if the colon is blocked. Imaging tests, such as aCTscan orMRI, may be needed to diagnose conditions that may be causing constipation.

## Tests of stool movement
Your health care professional may order a test that tracks the movement of stool through the colon. This is called a colorectal transit study. Such studies include:
- Radiopaque marker study.This X-ray procedure shows how far tiny pellets from a pill have moved through the colon over a period of time.
- Scintigraphy.This study involves eating a meal with tiny radioactive substances that are tracked with special technology as they move through the colon.

## Tests of the rectum and anus
Other tests may be used to measure how well the rectum and anus work and how well a person can pass stool.
- Anorectal manometry.A narrow, flexible tube is inserted into the anus and rectum. After a small balloonlike device is inflated, it is pulled back out the anus. The procedure measures the coordination of the muscles used to pass stool.
- Balloon expulsion test.This test measures the amount of time it takes to push out a small, water-filled balloon in the rectum. This provides information on how well muscles work or are controlled.
- Defecography.This test is designed to mimic passing stool. A thick substance that can be tracked with imaging technology is placed in the rectum. X-ray orMRIimages can reveal information about how well the rectum and anus work when the substance is passed like stool.

## Treatment
Treatment for constipation usually begins with diet and lifestyle changes meant to increase the speed at which stool moves through the colon. Also, your health care professional may change the medicines you take if they may be causing or worsening constipation. If those changes don't help, other treatments may be necessary.

## Diet and lifestyle changes
Your doctor may recommend the following changes to relieve your constipation:
- Eat a high-fiber diet.Fiber adds bulk to stool and helps the stool hold fluids. These factors give stool the right shape and weight to move through the colon. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole-grain bread, cereal and rice. Increase dietary fiber slowly to prevent bloating and gas. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 25 to 34 grams of fiber a day depending on recommended daily calories.
- Drink plenty of water.Drink water and beverages without caffeine. This keeps stools soft and prevents bloating and gas that can happen with increased dietary fiber.
- Exercise most days of the week.Regular physical activity helps improve the movement of stool through the colon. Try to exercise most days of the week. If you do not already exercise, talk with your health care professional about safe ways to start.
- Use good bowel habits.Don't avoid the urge to pass stool. Keep a schedule for passing stool. For example, try to pass stool 15 to 45 minutes after a meal because digestion helps move stool through the colon.
Prunes, also called dried plums, have long been used to treat or prevent constipation. Prunes are a good source of fiber, but they also have naturally present agents that draw fluids into the colon.

## Laxatives
Laxatives are medicines that help move stool through the colon. Each laxative works somewhat differently. The following are available without prescriptions:
- Fiber supplements.Fiber supplements help stool retain fluids. The stool is then softer and easier to pass. Fiber supplements include psyllium (Metamucil, Konsyl, others), calcium polycarbophil (FiberCon, Equalactin, others) and methylcellulose (Citrucel).
- Osmotics.Osmotic laxatives help stool move through the colon by increasing the amount of fluids released into the intestine. Examples include oral magnesium hydroxide (Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax Liquid, others), magnesium citrate, lactulose (Generlac) and polyethylene glycol (Miralax).
- Stimulants.Stimulants cause the walls of the intestine to tighten, forcing the movement of stool. These include bisacodyl (Correctol, Dulcolax Laxative, others) and sennosides (Senokot, Ex-Lax, Perdiem).
- Lubricants.Lubricants such as mineral oil enable stool to move through the colon more easily.
- Stool softeners.Stool softeners such as docusate sodium (Colace) and docusate calcium allow more fluids to be drawn into the stool.

## Enemas and suppositories
An enema is a fluid gently pumped into the rectum to help pass stool. An enema may be used when other treatments don't work. Your health care professional may use one of these if the rectum is blocked with stool. Some are also available without prescription. The fluid may be:
- Tap water.
- Tap water with mild soap.
- Mineral oil.
A suppository is a small tube-shaped object placed in the rectum to deliver a medicine. The suppository melts at body temperature and releases the medicine. Suppositories for constipation may have one of the following:
- Osmotic laxative.
- Stimulant laxative.
- Lubricant laxative.

## Prescription medicines
Your health care professional may prescribe other medicines if other treatments don't work. These include:
- Lubiprostone (Amitiza).
- Linaclotide (Linzess).
- Plecanatide (Trulance).
- Prucalopride (Motegrity).
If constipation is caused by opioid pain medicine, you may take a prescription medicine that blocks the effect of opioids on stool movement through the colon. These include:
- Methylnaltrexone (Relistor).
- Naldemedine (Symproic).
- Naloxegol (Movantik).

## Pelvic muscle training
Biofeedback training involves working with a therapist who uses devices to help you learn to relax muscles and coordinate the use of muscles in your pelvis, rectum and anus. These exercises may correct problems with chronic constipation.
Sensors in the rectum and on the skin provide feedback as sound or light on a device as the therapist helps you go through various exercises. These cues help train you to control the muscles needed to pass stool.

## Surgery
Surgery may be necessary to correct damage or irregularities in the tissues or nerves of the colon or rectum. Surgery is usually done only when other treatments for chronic constipation haven't worked.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Alternative medicine
Researcher are studying the use of probiotics and acupuncture to treat constipation. Further research is needed to understand these options.

## Preparing for your appointment
You'll likely first see your doctor or other general health care professional. You may be referred to a specialist in digestive disorders, called a gastroenterologist.
Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to cover, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor.

## What you can do
- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restricting your diet.
- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing.
- Write down key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes, such as traveling or be coming pregnant.
- Make a list of all medications,vitamins, supplements or herbal medications you're taking.
- Take a family member or friend along.Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who comes with you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
- Write down questionsto ask your doctor.
For constipation, some questions you might want to ask your doctor include:
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- What kinds of tests do I need, and how do I need to prepare for them?
- Am I at risk of complications related to this condition?
- What treatment do you recommend?
- If the first treatment doesn't work, what will we try next?
- Are there any dietary restrictions that I need to follow?
- I have other medical problems. How can I manage these along with constipation?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you several questions. Your doctor may ask:
- When did you did you first have symptoms of constipation?
- Have your symptoms been constant or off-and-on?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?
- Do your symptoms include stomach pain?
- Do your symptoms include vomiting?
- Have you recently lost weight without trying?
- How many meals do you eat a day?
- How much liquid, including water, do you drink a day?
- Do you see blood mixed in with the stool, in the toilet water or on the toilet paper?
- Do you strain when passing stool?
- Do you have any family history of digestive problems or colon cancer?
- Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
- Have you started any new medicines or recently changed the dosage of your current medicine?

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: INDIGESTION


## Overview
Indigestion — also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach — is discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion describes certain symptoms, such as belly pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating, rather than a specific disease. Indigestion can also be a symptom of other digestive disorders.
Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way. Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily.
Indigestion may often be relieved with lifestyle changes and medicines.

## Symptoms
If you have indigestion, you may have:
- Early fullness during a meal.You haven't eaten much of your meal, but you already feel full and may not be able to finish eating.
- Uncomfortable fullness after a meal.The feeling of fullness lasts longer than it should.
- Discomfort in the upper abdomen.You feel a mild to severe pain in the area between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton.
- Burning in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable heat or burning sensation between the bottom of your breastbone and your bellybutton.
- Bloating in the upper abdomen.You feel an uncomfortable sensation of tightness in your upper abdomen.
- Nausea.You feel as if you want to vomit.
Less frequent symptoms include vomiting and belching.
Sometimes people with indigestion also experience heartburn. Heartburn is a pain or burning feeling in the center of your chest that may radiate into your neck or back during or after eating.

## When to see a doctor
Mild indigestion is usually nothing to worry about. Consult your health care provider if discomfort lasts for more than two weeks.
Contact your provider right away if pain is severe or accompanied by:
- Unintentional weight loss or loss of appetite.
- Repeated vomiting or vomiting with blood.
- Black, tarry stools.
- Trouble swallowing that gets worse.
- Fatigue or weakness, which may be signs of anemia.
Seek immediate medical attention if you have:
- Shortness of breath, sweating or chest pain radiating to the jaw, neck or arm.
- Chest pain when you're active or stressed.

## Causes
Indigestion has many possible causes. Often, indigestion is related to lifestyle and may be triggered by food, drink or medicine. Common causes of indigestion include:
- Overeating or eating too quickly.
- Fatty, greasy or spicy foods.
- Too much caffeine, alcohol, chocolate or carbonated beverages.
- Smoking.
- Anxiety.
- Certain antibiotics, pain relievers and iron supplements.
A condition known as functional or nonulcer dyspepsia, which is related to irritable bowel syndrome, is a very common cause of indigestion.
Sometimes indigestion is caused by other conditions, including:
- Inflammation of the stomach, called gastritis.
- Peptic ulcers.
- Celiac disease.
- Gallstones.
- Constipation.
- Pancreas inflammation, called pancreatitis.
- Stomach cancer.
- Intestinal blockage.
- Reduced blood flow in the intestine, called intestinal ischemia.
- Diabetes.
- Thyroid disease.
- Pregnancy.

## Complications
Although indigestion doesn't usually have serious complications, it can affect your quality of life by making you feel uncomfortable and causing you to eat less. You might miss work or school because of your symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: INDIGESTION


## Diagnosis
Your health care provider is likely to start with a health history and a thorough physical exam. Those evaluations may be enough if your indigestion is mild and you're not experiencing certain symptoms, such as weight loss and repeated vomiting.
But if your indigestion began suddenly, and you are experiencing severe symptoms or are older than age 55, your provider may recommend:
- Laboratory tests,to check for anemia or other metabolic disorders.
- Breath and stool tests,to check for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the bacterium associated with peptic ulcers, which can cause indigestion.
- Endoscopy,to check for issues in your upper digestive tract, particularly in older people with symptoms that won't go away. A tissue sample, called a biopsy, may be taken for analysis.
- Imaging tests (X-ray or CT scan),to check for intestinal obstruction or another issue.

## Treatment
Lifestyle changes may help ease indigestion. Your health care provider may recommend:
- Avoiding foods that trigger indigestion.
- Eating five or six small meals a day instead of three large meals.
- Reducing or eliminating the use of alcohol and caffeine.
- Avoiding certain pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).
- Finding alternatives for medicines that trigger indigestion.
- Controlling stress and anxiety.
If your indigestion won't go away, medicines may help. Nonprescription antacids are generally the first choice. Other options include:
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),which can reduce stomach acid.PPIsmay be recommended particularly if you experience heartburn along with indigestion.
- H-2-receptor blockers,which can also reduce stomach acid.
- Prokinetics,which may be helpful if your stomach empties slowly.
- Antibiotics,which can help ifH. pyloribacteria are causing your indigestion.
- Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medicines,which may ease the discomfort from indigestion by decreasing your sensation of pain.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Mild indigestion can often be helped with lifestyle changes, including:
- Eating smaller, more-frequent meals.Chew your food slowly and thoroughly.
- Not eating certain foods.Fatty and spicy foods, processed foods, carbonated beverages, caffeine, alcohol, and smoking can trigger indigestion.
- Maintaining a healthy weight.Excess pounds put pressure on your abdomen, pushing up your stomach and causing acid to back up into your esophagus.
- Exercising regularly.Exercise helps you keep off extra weight and promotes better digestion.
- Managing stress.Create a calm environment at mealtime. Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation or yoga. Spend time doing things you enjoy. Get plenty of sleep.
- Changing your medicines.With your health care provider's approval, stop or cut back on pain relievers or other medicines that may irritate your stomach lining. If that's not an option, be sure to take these medicines with food.

## Alternative medicine
Alternative and complementary treatments have been used for many years to ease indigestion, although their effectiveness varies from person to person. These treatments include:
- Herbal therapies, including plain peppermint, or a combination of peppermint and caraway oils and the Japanese herbal formula rikkunshito.
- STW 5 (Iberogast), a liquid supplement containing extracts of nine herbs, may work by reducing the production of gastric acid.
- Acupuncture, which may work by blocking the pathways of nerves that carry sensations of pain to the brain.
- Psychological treatment, including behavior modification, relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy, is often very helpful.
Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements to be sure you're taking a safe dose. This is also important to make sure the supplement won't react with any other medicines you're taking.

## Preparing for your appointment
You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider, or you may be referred to a provider who specializes in digestive diseases, called a gastroenterologist. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to expect.

## What you can do
- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions,such as not eating solid food on the day before your appointment.
- Write down your symptoms,including when they started and how they may have changed or worsened over time.
- Take a list of all your medicines,vitamins or supplements.
- Write down your key medical information,including other diagnosed conditions.
- Write down key personal information,including any recent changes or stressors in your life, as well as a detailed description of your typical daily diet.
- Write down questions to askduring your appointment.
Some basic questions to ask include:
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- Do you think my condition is temporary or chronic?
- What kinds of tests do I need?
- What treatments can help?
- Are there any dietary restrictions that I need to follow?
- Could any of my medications be causing my symptoms?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Be ready to answer questions your provider may ask:
- When did you first begin experiencing symptoms, and how severe are they?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- What, if anything, seems to improve or worsen your symptoms?
- What medications and pain relievers do you take?
- What do you eat and drink, including alcohol, in a typical day?
- How have you been feeling emotionally?
- Do you use tobacco? If so, do you smoke, chew or both?
- Are your symptoms better or worse on an empty stomach?
- Have you vomited blood or black material?
- Have you had any changes in your bowel habits, including stools turning black?
- Have you lost weight?
- Have you had nausea or vomiting or both?

DISEASE NAME: GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD)


## Overview
Gastroesophageal reflux disease happens when stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus and causes heartburn. It's often called GERD for short. This backwash is known as acid reflux, and it can irritate the lining of the esophagus.
Many people experience acid reflux now and then. However, when acid reflux happens repeatedly over time, it can cause GERD.
Most people can manage the discomfort of GERD with lifestyle changes and medicines. And though it's uncommon, some may need surgery to help with symptoms.

## Symptoms
Common symptoms of GERD include:
- A burning sensation in the chest, often called heartburn. Heartburn usually happens after eating and might be worse at night or while lying down.
- Backwash of food or sour liquid in the throat.
- Upper belly or chest pain.
- Trouble swallowing, called dysphagia.
- Sensation of a lump in the throat.
If you have nighttime acid reflux, you also might experience:
- An ongoing cough.
- Inflammation of the vocal cords, known as laryngitis.
- New or worsening asthma.

## When to see a doctor
Seek medical help right away if you have chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath, or jaw or arm pain. These may be symptoms of a heart attack.
Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you:
- Have severe or frequent GERD symptoms.
- Take nonprescription medicines for heartburn more than twice a week.

## Causes
GERD is caused by frequent acid reflux or reflux of nonacidic content from the stomach.
When you swallow, a circular band of muscle around the bottom of the esophagus, called the lower esophageal sphincter, relaxes to allow food and liquid to flow into the stomach. Then the sphincter closes again.
If the sphincter does not relax as is typical or it weakens, stomach acid can flow back into the esophagus. This constant backwash of acid irritates the lining of the esophagus, often causing it to become inflamed.

## Risk factors
Conditions that can increase the risk of GERD include:
- Obesity.
- Bulging of the top of the stomach up above the diaphragm, known as a hiatal hernia.
- Pregnancy.
- Connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma.
- Delayed stomach emptying.
Factors that can aggravate acid reflux include:
- Smoking.
- Eating large meals or eating late at night.
- Eating certain foods, such as fatty or fried foods.
- Drinking certain beverages, such as alcohol or coffee.
- Taking certain medicines, such as aspirin.

## Complications
Over time, long-lasting inflammation in the esophagus can cause:
- Inflammation of the tissue in the esophagus, known as esophagitis.Stomach acid can break down tissue in the esophagus. This can cause inflammation, bleeding and sometimes an open sore, called an ulcer. Esophagitis can cause pain and make swallowing difficult.
- Narrowing of the esophagus, called an esophageal stricture.Damage to the lower esophagus from stomach acid causes scar tissue to form. The scar tissue narrows the food pathway, leading to problems with swallowing.
- Precancerous changes to the esophagus, known as Barrett esophagus.Damage from acid can cause changes in the tissue lining the lower esophagus. These changes are associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD)


## Diagnosis
A healthcare professional might be able to diagnose GERD based on a history of symptoms and a physical examination.
To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, or to check for complications, a care professional might recommend:
- Upper endoscopy.An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube to visually examine the upper digestive system. The camera helps provide a view of the inside of the esophagus and stomach. Test results may not show when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may find inflammation of the esophagus or other complications.An endoscopy also can be used to collect a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, to be tested for complications such as Barrett esophagus. In some instances, if a narrowing is seen in the esophagus, it can be stretched or dilated during this procedure. This is done to improve trouble swallowing.

- Ambulatory acid (pH) probe test.A monitor is placed in the esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that's worn around the waist or with a strap over the shoulder.The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, that's threaded through the nose into the esophagus. Or it might be a clip that's placed in the esophagus during an endoscopy. The clip passes into the stool after about two days.

- X-ray of the upper digestive system.X-rays are taken after drinking a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of the digestive tract. The coating allows a healthcare professional to see a silhouette of the esophagus and stomach. This is particularly useful for people who are having trouble swallowing.Sometimes, an X-ray is done after swallowing a barium pill. This can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that's interfering with swallowing.

Sometimes, an X-ray is done after swallowing a barium pill. This can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that's interfering with swallowing.
- Esophageal manometry.This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in the esophagus while swallowing. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of the esophagus. This is typically done in people who have trouble swallowing.
- Transnasal esophagoscopy.This test is done to look for any damage in the esophagus. A thin, flexible tube with a video camera is put through the nose and moved down the throat into the esophagus. The camera sends pictures to a video screen.

## Treatment
A healthcare professional is likely to recommend trying lifestyle changes and nonprescription medicines as a first line of treatment. If you don't experience relief within a few weeks, prescription medicine and additional testing may be recommended.

## Nonprescription medicines
Options include:
- Antacids that neutralize stomach acid.Antacids containing calcium carbonate, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney complications.
- Medicines to reduce acid production.These medicines — known as histamine (H-2) blockers — include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid). H-2 blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.
- Medicines that block acid production and heal the esophagus.These medicines — known as proton pump inhibitors — are stronger acid blockers than H-2 blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Nonprescription proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) and esomeprazole (Nexium).
If you start taking a nonprescription medicine for GERD, be sure to inform your care provider.

## Prescription medicines
Prescription-strength treatments for GERD include:
- Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors.These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant).Although generally well tolerated, these medicines might cause diarrhea, headaches, nausea or, in rare instances, low vitamin B-12 or magnesium levels.

Although generally well tolerated, these medicines might cause diarrhea, headaches, nausea or, in rare instances, low vitamin B-12 or magnesium levels.
- Prescription-strength H-2 blockers.These include prescription-strength famotidine and nizatidine. Side effects from these medicines are generally mild and well tolerated.
- Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs).This new class of medicines may be recommended for someone with severe acid reflux if other medicines haven't worked. They include vonoprazan (Voquezna) and tegoprazan (K-Cab).

## Deep-breathing training
A technique known as diaphragmatic breathing may help improve GERD symptoms for some people. This exercise is done after eating. It involves breathing deeply into the diaphragm rather than shallowly into the chest. Diaphragmatic breathing techniques should ideally be taught by a trained medical professional.

## Surgery and other procedures
GERD can usually be controlled with medicine. But if medicines don't help or you wish to avoid long-term medicine use, a healthcare professional might recommend:
- Fundoplication.The surgeon wraps the top of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive, called laparoscopic, procedure. The wrapping of the top part of the stomach can be partial or complete, known as Nissen fundoplication. The most common partial procedure is the Toupet fundoplication. Your surgeon typically recommends the type that is best for you.
- LINX device.A ring of tiny magnetic beads is wrapped around the junction of the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction between the beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to refluxing acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. The LINX device can be implanted using minimally invasive surgery. The magnetic beads do not affect airport security or magnetic resonance imaging.
- Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF).This new procedure involves tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by creating a partial wrap around the lower esophagus using polypropylene fasteners. TIF is performed through the mouth by using an endoscope and requires no surgical incision. Its advantages include quick recovery time and high tolerance.If you have a large hiatal hernia, TIF alone is not an option. However, TIF may be possible if it is combined with laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.

If you have a large hiatal hernia, TIF alone is not an option. However, TIF may be possible if it is combined with laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.
Because obesity can be a risk factor for GERD, a healthcare professional could suggest weight-loss surgery as an option for treatment. Talk with your healthcare team to find out if you're a candidate for this type of surgery.

## Emerging therapies

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Lifestyle changes may help reduce the frequency of acid reflux. Try to:
- Maintain a healthy weight.Excess pounds put pressure on the abdomen, pushing up the stomach and causing acid to reflux into the esophagus.
- Stop smoking.Smoking decreases the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to function properly.
- Elevate the head of your bed.If you regularly experience heartburn while trying to sleep, place wood or cement blocks under the feet at the head end of your bed. Raise the head end by 6 to 9 inches. If you can't elevate your bed, you can insert a wedge between your mattress and box spring to elevate your body from the waist up. Raising your head with additional pillows isn't effective.
- Start on your left side.When you go to bed, start by lying on your left side to help make it less likely to have reflux.
- Don't lie down after a meal.Wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed.
- Eat food slowly and chew thoroughly.Put down your fork after every bite and pick it up again once you have chewed and swallowed that bite.
- Don't consume foods and drinks that trigger reflux.Common triggers include alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, fatty foods or peppermint.
- Don't wear tight-fitting clothing.Clothes that fit tightly around the waist put pressure on the abdomen and the lower esophageal sphincter.

## Alternative medicine
Some complementary and alternative therapies, such as ginger, chamomile and slippery elm, may be recommended to treat GERD. However, none have been proved to treat GERD or reverse damage to the esophagus. Talk to a healthcare professional if you're considering taking alternative therapies to treat GERD.

## Preparing for your appointment
You may be referred to a doctor who specializes in the digestive system, called a gastroenterologist.

## What you can do
- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions,such as restricting your diet before your appointment.
- Write down your symptoms,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason why you scheduled the appointment.
- Write down any triggers to your symptoms,such as specific foods.
- Make a list of all your medicines,vitamins and supplements.
- Write down your key medical information,including other conditions.
- Write down key personal information,along with any recent changes or stressors in your life.
- Write down questions to askyour doctor.
- Ask a relative or friend to go with you,to help you remember what was talked about.

## Questions to ask your doctor
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- What tests do I need? Is there any special preparation for them?
- Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
- What treatments are available?
- Are there any restrictions I need to follow?
- I have other health concerns. How can I best manage these conditions together?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment anytime you don't understand something.

## What to expect from your doctor
You're likely to be asked a few questions. Being ready to answer them may leave time to go over points you want to spend more time on. You may be asked:
- When did you begin experiencing symptoms? How severe are they?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- What, if anything, seems to improve or worsen your symptoms?
- Do your symptoms wake you up at night?
- Are your symptoms worse after meals or lying down?
- Does food or sour material ever come up in the back of your throat?
- Do you have trouble swallowing food, or have you had to change your diet to avoid difficulty swallowing?
- Have you gained or lost weight?

DISEASE NAME: HAY FEVER


## Overview
Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. Hay fever is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).
Common allergens that can trigger hay fever symptoms include pollen and dust mites. Tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers (pet dander) also can be allergens.
Besides making you miserable, hay fever can affect how well you perform at work or school and can generally interfere with your life. But you don't have to put up with annoying symptoms. You can learn to avoid triggers and find the right treatment.

## Symptoms
Hay fever symptoms can include:
- Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion.
- Watery, itchy, red eyes.
- Sneezing.
- Cough.
- Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat.
- Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip.
- Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners.
- Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.

## Hay fever triggers
Your hay fever symptoms may occur year-round or may start or worsen at a particular time of year. These are known as seasonal allergies.
Hay fever triggers include:
- Tree pollen, which is common in early spring.
- Grass pollen, which is common in late spring and summer.
- Ragweed pollen, which is common in fall.
- Dust mites and cockroach droppings, which are present year-round.
- Dander from pets, which can be bothersome year-round but might cause worse symptoms in winter, when houses are closed up.
- Spores from indoor and outdoor fungi and molds, which can be both seasonal and year-round.

## Hay fever or common cold?
Symptoms can be similar, so it can be difficult to tell which one you have.

## When to see a doctor
See a healthcare professional if:
- You can't find relief from your hay fever symptoms.
- Allergy medicines don't provide relief, or they cause side effects.
- You have another condition that can worsen hay fever symptoms, such as nasal polyps, asthma or frequent sinus infections.
Many people — especially children — get used to hay fever symptoms, so they might not seek treatment until the symptoms become severe. But getting the right treatment might offer relief.

## Causes
When someone has hay fever, the immune system identifies a harmless airborne substance as being harmful. This substance is called an allergen. The body produces immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to protect against allergens. When the body comes in contact with an allergen, these antibodies signal the immune system to release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. This causes a reaction that leads to the symptoms of hay fever.

## Risk factors
The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:
- Having other allergies or asthma.
- Having a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.
- Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.
- Living or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.
- Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.
- Having a mother who smoked during the first year of life.

## Complications
Problems that may go along with hay fever include:
- Reduced quality of life.Hay fever can interfere with enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.
- Poor sleep.Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell, called malaise.
- Worsening asthma.Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.
- Sinusitis.Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.
- Ear infection.In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection, called otitis media.

## Prevention
There's no way to avoid getting hay fever. If you have hay fever, the best thing to do is to lessen your exposure to the allergens that cause your symptoms. Take allergy medicines before you're exposed to allergens, as directed by your healthcare professional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: HAY FEVER


## Diagnosis
To diagnose hay fever, a healthcare professional typically does a physical exam and talks about general health, symptoms and possible triggers. One or both of these tests may be recommended:
- Skin prick test.Small amounts of material that can trigger allergies are pricked into patches of skin on the arm or upper back. A medical professional then watches the skin for an allergic reaction. If someone has an allergy, a raised bump called a hive forms at the site of that allergen. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.
- Allergy blood test.A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure the immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in the bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.

## Treatment
Once someone knows their allergy triggers, a healthcare professional can help develop a treatment plan to reduce or get rid of hay fever symptoms.
It's best to limit exposure to substances that cause hay fever. If hay fever isn't too severe, nonprescription medicines may be enough to relieve symptoms. For worse symptoms, prescription medicines may be needed.
Many people get the best relief from a combination of allergy medicines. Sometimes, a few different options need to be tried before finding what works best.
If a child has hay fever, talk with the child's healthcare professional about treatment. Not all medicines are approved for use in children. Read labels carefully.
Treatments for hay fever may include medicines, immunotherapy and nasal saline rinses.

## Medicines for hay fever
These nasal sprays help prevent and treat the nasal stuffiness and the itchy, runny nose caused by hay fever. For many people, nasal sprays are the most effective hay fever medicines, and they're often the first type of medicine recommended.
- Nonprescription nasal spraysinclude fluticasone (Flonase Allergy Relief), budesonide (Rhinocort Allergy), triamcinolone (Nasacort Allergy 24HR) and mometasone (Nasonex 24HR Allergy).
- Prescription nasal sprays that combine an antihistamine with a steroidinclude azelastine and fluticasone (Dymista) and mometasone and olopatadine (Ryaltris).
Nasal corticosteroids are a safe, long-term treatment for most people. Side effects can include an unpleasant smell or taste and nose irritation. Steroid side effects from a nasal spray are rare.
A symptom-causing chemical, called histamine, is released by the immune system during an allergic reaction. Antihistamines work by blocking histamine. These medicines can help with itching, sneezing and a runny nose but have less of an effect on congestion. Antihistamines are usually given as pills or tablets. However, there are also antihistamine nasal sprays that can relieve nasal symptoms. Antihistamine eyedrops can help relieve eye itchiness and irritation.
- Oral antihistamines available without a prescriptioninclude loratadine (Claritin, Alavert), cetirizine and fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy).
- Nonprescription eye dropsinclude olopatadine (Pataday, Patanol) and ketotifen (Alaway, Zaditor).
- Nonprescription nasal spraysinclude azelastine (Astepro Allergy).
- Prescription nasal spraysinclude olopatadine.
Common side effects of antihistamines are dry mouth, nose and eyes. Some oral antihistamines may make you sleepy. Other side effects of oral antihistamines can include restlessness, headaches, changes in appetite, trouble sleeping, and problems with blood pressure and urinating. Talk to a healthcare professional before taking antihistamines, especially if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or have glaucoma or an enlarged prostate.
Decongestants reduce nasal stuffiness and pressure from swelling. Because they do not relieve other symptoms of hay fever, they're sometimes combined with other medicines such as antihistamines.
Decongestants are available as liquids, tablets and nasal sprays. They also are available with and without a prescription.
- Oral decongestantsinclude pseudoephedrine (Sudafed).
- Nasal decongestant spraysinclude phenylephrine hydrochloride (Neo-Synephrine) and oxymetazoline (Afrin).
Oral decongestants can cause a few side effects, including increased blood pressure, insomnia, irritability and headache. Decongestants may cause problems urinating if you have an enlarged prostate. Check with a healthcare professional before taking decongestants if you have high blood pressure or heart disease or if you're pregnant.
Don't use a decongestant nasal spray for more than 2 to 3 days at a time because it can worsen symptoms when used continuously. This is known as rebound congestion.
Cromolyn sodium can help relieve hay fever symptoms by preventing the release of histamine. This medicine is most effective if you start using it before you have symptoms. Cromolyn is available as a nonprescription nasal spray to be used several times a day. It also is available in eye drop form with a prescription. Cromolyn doesn't have serious side effects.
Montelukast (Singulair) is a prescription tablet taken to block the action of leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are immune system chemicals that cause allergy symptoms, such as irritation in the nose and making too much mucus. It's especially effective in treating allergy-induced asthma. It's often used when nasal sprays can't be tolerated or for mild asthma.
Montelukast can cause headaches. In rare cases, it has been linked to psychological reactions such as insomnia, anxiety, depression and suicidal thinking. Get medical advice right away for any unusual psychological reaction.
Available in a prescription nasal spray, ipratropium helps relieve severe runny nose by preventing the glands in the nose from making too much mucus. It's not effective for treating congestion, itching or sneezing.
Mild side effects include dry nose, nosebleeds, dry and irritated eyes, and sore throat. Rarely, the medicine can cause more-severe side effects, such as blurred vision, dizziness and trouble urinating. This medicine is not recommended if you have glaucoma or an enlarged prostate.
Corticosteroid pills such as prednisone sometimes are used to relieve severe allergy symptoms. Because the long-term use of corticosteroids can cause serious side effects such as cataracts, osteoporosis and muscle weakness, they're usually prescribed for only short periods of time.

## Immunotherapy for hay fever
Also called immunotherapy or desensitization therapy, allergy shots change the way the immune system reacts to allergens. If medicines don't relieve hay fever symptoms or cause too many side effects, a healthcare professional may recommend allergy shots. Over 3 to 5 years, you'll get regular shots containing tiny amounts of allergens. The goal is to get your body used to the allergens that cause your symptoms and decrease your need for medicines.
Immunotherapy might be especially effective if you're allergic to animal dander, dust mites or pollen produced by trees, grass or weeds. In children, immunotherapy may help prevent asthma.
Rather than getting shots, this therapy involves taking tiny amounts of allergen in pill form that dissolves under the tongue. This is known as sublingual delivery. Pills are usually taken daily. Sublingual allergy tablets don't work for all allergens but can be helpful for grass and ragweed pollens and dust mites.

## Nasal saline rinses for hay fever
Saline nasal sprays can moisten dry nasal passages and thin nasal mucus. You don't need a prescription, and you can use them as often as needed.
Rinsing your nasal passages with saline, called nasal irrigation, is a quick and effective way to relieve nasal congestion. Rinsing flushes out mucus and allergens from your nose. Saline irrigation is a water-based solution that contains a tiny amount of salt (sodium) and other ingredients.
Saline irrigation solutions can be purchased ready-made or as kits to add to water. You also can use a homemade solution. Look for a squeeze bottle or a neti pot — a small container with a spout designed for nose rinsing — at your pharmacy or health food store.
To make up the saline irrigation solution, do not use tap water, as it can contain organisms that could cause infection. Use water that's distilled or sterile. You also can use water that was boiled and cooled. Another option is using water that has been filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller.
To prevent infections, wash the bottle or pot with hot soapy water and rinse it after every use and leave it open to air-dry. Do not share a container with other people.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
It's not possible to avoid allergens completely, but you can reduce your symptoms by limiting your exposure to these substances. If you know what you're allergic to, you can avoid your triggers. Consider some of these tips.

## Pollen or molds
Pollen and mold spores are fine dustlike particles that plants use in fertilization. They float in the wind and can get into your nose and eyes.
- Close doors and windows during pollen season.
- Don't hang laundry outside — pollen can stick to sheets and towels.
- Use air conditioning in your house and car.
- Use an allergy-grade filter in your home ventilation system and change it regularly.
- Don't do outdoor activities in the early morning, when pollen counts are highest, and also on high pollen-count days.
- Stay indoors on dry, windy days.
- Use a dehumidifier to reduce indoor humidity.
- Use a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in your bedroom and other rooms where you spend a lot of time.
- Don't mow the lawn or rake leaves.
- Wear a dust mask when cleaning house or gardening.
- Wear glasses or sunglasses when outside to limit pollen getting in your eyes.

## Dust mites
Dust mites are tiny, insect-like pests that are common in dust. They live in bedding, carpets, upholstery and stuffed animals. Dust mites prefer warm, humid spaces.
- Use allergy-proof covers on mattresses, box springs and pillows.
- Wash sheets, blankets and stuffed animals at least weekly in water heated to at least 130 F (54 C).
- Use a dehumidifier or air conditioner to reduce indoor humidity.
- Vacuum carpets weekly with a vacuum cleaner equipped with a small-particle or HEPA filter.
- Consider removing carpeting, especially where you sleep, if you're highly sensitive to dust mites.
- Use a damp mop and dust cloth to avoid stirring up dust.

## Cockroaches
Cockroaches leave tiny droppings that can become airborne. Getting rid of the insects gets rid of their droppings.
- Block cracks and crevices where cockroaches can enter.
- Seal around and fix leaky faucets and pipes.
- Wash dishes and empty garbage and recyclables daily.
- Sweep food crumbs from counters and floors.
- Store food, including pet food, in sealed containers.
- Consider professional pest extermination.

## Pet dander
Pet dander is tiny flecks of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other animals with fur or feathers. Pet urine and saliva also may contain allergens.
- Keep pets out of your home, if possible.
- Bathe dogs twice a week, if possible. The benefit of bathing cats hasn't been proved.
- Keep pets out of your bedroom and off furniture.
- Vacuum carpets often with a vacuum cleaner equipped with a small-particle or HEPA filter.
- Wash your hands after petting an animal.
- Wash clothes after contact with an animal.
- Ask a person without allergies to provide grooming and cleaning of pet areas.
- Consider removing carpeting, especially where you sleep, if you're highly sensitive to pet dander.
- Use a damp mop and dust cloth to avoid stirring up pet dander.

## Alternative medicine
While there isn't much evidence about how well alternative treatments work, people sometimes try them for hay fever. Examples include:
- Herbal remedies and supplements.Extracts of the shrub butterbur may help prevent seasonal allergy symptoms. If you try butterbur, be sure to use a product that's labeled PA-free, which indicates that it's had potentially toxic substances removed.There's some limited evidence that spirulina and Tinospora cordifolia also may be effective. Though their benefits are unclear, other herbal remedies for seasonal allergies include capsicum, honey, vitamin C and fish oil.Herbal remedies and supplements are not evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the way medications are. Discuss these products with your health care provider before using them.

- Acupuncture.Some people claim that acupuncture can help with seasonal allergy symptoms. There's limited evidence that these treatments work, but there's also little evidence of harm.

## Preparing for your appointment
You're likely to start by seeing your primary healthcare professional. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist or other specialist.
Take a family member or friend along, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember information.
Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment. Before your appointment, make a list of:
- Your symptoms,when they occur and what seems to trigger them. Include symptoms that might seem unrelated to hay fever.
- Recent life changes,such as a move to a new home or new part of the country.
- All medicines you take,including vitamins, herbs and supplements, and their dosages.
- Questionsto ask during your appointment.
For hay fever, questions to ask include:
- What is likely causing my symptoms?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely to go away on its own?
- What is the best course of action?
- What other treatments or ways to avoid triggers can you suggest?
- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there restrictions I should follow?
- Should I see a specialist?
- Are there brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health professional is likely to ask a few questions, including:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- What seems to trigger your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- Do any of your blood relatives, such as a parent or sibling, have hay fever or other allergies?
- Do your symptoms interfere with work, school or sleep?

## What you can do in the meantime
While waiting for your appointment, remedies available without a prescription may help ease hay fever symptoms. They include pills, liquids, nasal sprays and eye drops. Also, try to reduce your exposure to possible triggers, if possible.

DISEASE NAME: ASTHMA


## Overview
Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath.
For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.
Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.

## Symptoms
Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time.
Asthma signs and symptoms include:
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children
- Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing
- Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu
Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include:
- Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome
- Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter)
- The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often
For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations:
- Exercise-induced asthma,which may be worse when the air is cold and dry
- Occupational asthma,triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust
- Allergy-induced asthma,triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander)

## When to see a doctor
Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include:
- Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing
- No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler
- Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity
See your doctor:
- If you think you have asthma.If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time.
- To monitor your asthma after diagnosis.If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.
- If your asthma symptoms get worse.Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.
If your asthma symptoms get worse.Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.
Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.
- To review your treatment.Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.

## Causes
It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.

## Asthma triggers
Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:
- Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste
- Respiratory infections, such as the common cold
- Physical activity
- Cold air
- Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke
- Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)
- Strong emotions and stress
- Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat

## Risk factors
A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:
- Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling
- Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes
- Being overweight
- Being a smoker
- Exposure to secondhand smoke
- Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution
- Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing

## Complications
Asthma complications include:
- Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities
- Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups
- A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe
- Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks
- Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma
Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma.

## Prevention
While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks.
- Follow your asthma action plan.With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan.Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life.

- Get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia.Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups.
- Identify and avoid asthma triggers.A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers.
- Monitor your breathing.You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath.But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home.

- Identify and treat attacks early.If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms.When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan.

- Take your medication as prescribed.Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose.
- Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use.If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment.

DISEASE NAME: ASTHMA


## Diagnosis

## Physical exam
Your doctor will perform a physical exam to rule out other possible conditions, such as a respiratory infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Your doctor will also ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems.

## Tests to measure lung function
You may be given lung function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include:
- Spirometry.This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out.
- Peak flow.A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign that your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings.
Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication to open your airways called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it's likely you have asthma.

## Additional tests
Other tests to diagnose asthma include:
- Methacholine challenge.Methacholine is a known asthma trigger. When inhaled, it will cause your airways to narrow slightly. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal.
- Imaging tests.A chest X-ray can help identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems.
- Allergy testing.Allergy tests can be performed by a skin test or blood test. They tell you if you're allergic to pets, dust, mold or pollen. If allergy triggers are identified, your doctor may recommend allergy shots.
- Nitric oxide test.This test measures the amount of the gas nitric oxide in your breath. When your airways are inflamed — a sign of asthma — you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. This test isn't widely available.
- Sputum eosinophils.This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye.
- Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma.In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air.

## How asthma is classified
To classify your asthma severity, your doctor will consider how often you have signs and symptoms and how severe they are. Your doctor will also consider the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests.
Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments.
Asthma is classified into four general categories:

## Treatment
Prevention and long-term control are key to stopping asthma attacks before they start. Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers, taking steps to avoid triggers and tracking your breathing to make sure your medications are keeping symptoms under control. In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler.

## Medications
The right medications for you depend on a number of things — your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what works best to keep your asthma under control.
Preventive, long-term control medications reduce the swelling (inflammation) in your airways that leads to symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary.
Long-term asthma control medications,generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely you'll have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include:
- Inhaled corticosteroids.These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta).You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects.

You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects.
- Leukotriene modifiers.These oral medications — including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) — help relieve asthma symptoms.Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions.

Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions.
- Combination inhalers.These medications — such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) — contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid.
- Theophylline.Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests.
Quick-relief (rescue) medicationsare used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack. They may also be used before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include:
- Short-acting beta agonists.These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex, Xopenex HFA).Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They're inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.

Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They're inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.
- Anticholinergic agents.Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) and tiotropium (Spiriva, Spiriva Respimat) act quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. They're mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but can be used to treat asthma.
- Oral and intravenous corticosteroids.These medications — which include prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol) — relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so these drugs are used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms.
If you have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away. But you shouldn't need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often if your long-term control medications are working properly.
Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week. If you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, see your doctor. You probably need to adjust your long-term control medication.
Allergy medicationsmay help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. These include:
- Allergy shots (immunotherapy).Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years.
- Biologics.These medications — which include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent), reslizumab (Cinqair), benralizumab (Fasenra) and tezepelumab (Tezspire) — are specifically for people who have severe asthma.

## Bronchial thermoplasty
This treatment is used for severe asthma that doesn't improve with inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma medications. It isn't widely available nor right for everyone.
During bronchial thermoplasty, your doctor heats the insides of the airways in the lungs with an electrode. The heat reduces the smooth muscle inside the airways. This limits the ability of the airways to tighten, making breathing easier and possibly reducing asthma attacks. The therapy is generally done over three outpatient visits.

## Treat by severity for better control: A stepwise approach
Your treatment should be flexible and based on changes in your symptoms. Your doctor should ask about your symptoms at each visit. Based on your signs and symptoms, your doctor can adjust your treatment accordingly.
For example, if your asthma is well controlled, your doctor may prescribe less medication. If your asthma isn't well controlled or is getting worse, your doctor may increase your medication and recommend more-frequent visits.

## Asthma action plan
Work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that outlines in writing when to take certain medications or when to increase or decrease the dose of your medications based on your symptoms. Also include a list of your triggers and the steps you need to take to avoid them.
Your doctor may also recommend tracking your asthma symptoms or using a peak flow meter on a regular basis to monitor how well your treatment is controlling your asthma.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Although many people with asthma rely on medications to prevent and relieve symptoms, you can do several things on your own to maintain your health and lessen the possibility of asthma attacks.

## Avoid your triggers
Taking steps to reduce your exposure to asthma triggers is a key part of asthma control. To reduce your exposure, you should:
- Use your air conditioner.Air conditioning reduces the amount of airborne pollen from trees, grasses and weeds that finds its way indoors. Air conditioning also lowers indoor humidity and can reduce your exposure to dust mites. If you don't have air conditioning, try to keep your windows closed during pollen season.
- Decontaminate your decor.Minimize dust that may worsen nighttime symptoms by replacing certain items in your bedroom. For example, encase pillows, mattresses and box springs in dustproof covers. Avoid using down-filled pillows and blankets. Throughout the house, remove carpeting and install hardwood or linoleum flooring. Use washable curtains and blinds.
- Maintain optimal humidity.If you live in a damp climate, talk to your doctor about using a dehumidifier.
- Prevent mold spores.Clean damp areas in the bathroom, kitchen and around the house to keep mold spores from developing. Get rid of moldy leaves or damp firewood in the yard.
- Reduce pet dander.If you're allergic to dander, avoid pets with fur or feathers. Having pets regularly bathed or groomed may also reduce the amount of dander in your surroundings.
- Clean regularly.Clean your home at least once a week. If you're likely to stir up dust, wear a mask or have someone else do the cleaning. Wash your bedding regularly.
- Cover your nose and mouth if it's cold out.If your asthma is worsened by cold or dry air, wearing a face mask can help.

## Stay healthy
Taking care of yourself can help keep your symptoms under control, including:
- Get regular exercise.Having asthma doesn't mean you have to be less active. Treatment can prevent asthma attacks and control symptoms during activity.Regular exercise can strengthen your heart and lungs, which helps relieve asthma symptoms. If you exercise in cold temperatures, wear a face mask to warm the air you breathe.

Regular exercise can strengthen your heart and lungs, which helps relieve asthma symptoms. If you exercise in cold temperatures, wear a face mask to warm the air you breathe.
- Maintain a healthy weight.Being overweight can worsen asthma symptoms, and it puts you at higher risk of other health problems.
- Control heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).It's possible that the acid reflux that causes heartburn may damage lung airways and worsen asthma symptoms. If you have frequent or constant heartburn, talk to your doctor about treatment options. You may need treatment forGERDbefore your asthma symptoms improve.

## Alternative medicine
Certain alternative treatments may help with asthma symptoms. However, keep in mind that these treatments are not a replacement for medical treatment, especially if you have severe asthma. Talk to your doctor before taking any herbs or supplements, as some may interact with the medications you take.
In most cases, more research is needed to see how well alternative remedies work and to measure the extent of possible side effects. Alternative asthma treatments include:
- Breathing exercises.These exercises may reduce the amount of medication you need to keep your asthma symptoms under control.
- Herbal and natural remedies.A few herbal and natural remedies that may help improve asthma symptoms include black seed, caffeine, choline and pycnogenol.

## Coping and support
Asthma can be challenging and stressful. You may sometimes become frustrated, angry or depressed because you need to cut back on your usual activities to avoid environmental triggers. You may also feel limited or embarrassed by the symptoms of the disease and by complicated management routines.
But asthma doesn't have to be a limiting condition. The best way to overcome anxiety and a feeling of helplessness is to understand your condition and take control of your treatment. Here are some suggestions that may help:
- Pace yourself.Take breaks between tasks and avoid activities that make your symptoms worse.
- Make a daily to-do list.This may help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. Reward yourself for accomplishing simple goals.
- Talk to others with your condition.Chat rooms and message boards on the internet or support groups in your area can connect you with people facing similar challenges and let you know that you're not alone.
- If your child has asthma, be encouraging.Focus attention on the things your child can do, not on the things he or she can't. Involve teachers, school nurses, coaches, friends and relatives in helping your child manage asthma.

## Preparing for your appointment
You're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist or a pulmonologist.
Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to be well prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, as well as what to expect from your doctor.

## What you can do
These steps can help you make the most of your appointment:
- Write down any symptoms you're having,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
- Note when your symptoms bother you most.For example, write down if your symptoms tend to get worse at certain times of the day, during certain seasons, or when you're exposed to cold air, pollen or other triggers.
- Write down key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes.
- Make a list of all medications,vitamins and supplements that you're taking.
- Take a family member or friend along,if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to recall all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
- Write down questions to askyour doctor.
Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For asthma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
- Is asthma the most likely cause of my breathing problems?
- Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms?
- What kinds of tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
- What's the best treatment?
- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?
- Should I see a specialist?
- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?
- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend visiting?
In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:
- What exactly are your symptoms?
- When did you first notice your symptoms?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- Do you have breathing problems most of the time or only at certain times or in certain situations?
- Do you have allergies, such as atopic dermatitis or hay fever?
- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- Do allergies or asthma run in your family?
- Do you have any chronic health problems?

DISEASE NAME: BRONCHITIS


## Overview
Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic).
Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks.
Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

## Symptoms
If you have acute bronchitis, you may have cold symptoms, such as:
- Cough
- Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood
- Sore throat
- Mild headache and body aches
- Slight fever and chills
- Fatigue
- Chest discomfort
- Shortness of breath and wheezing
While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks.
For chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include:
- Cough
- Production of mucus
- Fatigue
- Chest discomfort
- Shortness of breath
Chronic bronchitis is typically defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with bouts that recur for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. It's also possible to have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis.

## When to see a doctor
Contact your doctor or clinic for advice if your cough:
- Is accompanied by a fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C).
- Produces blood.
- Is associated with serious or worsening shortness of breath or wheezing.
- Includes other serious signs and symptoms, for example, you appear pale and lethargic, have a bluish tinge to your lips and nail beds, or have trouble thinking clearly or concentrating.
- Lasts more than three weeks.
Before you go in, your doctor or clinic can give you guidance on how to prepare for your appointment.

## Causes
Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Many different viruses — all of which are very contagious — can cause acute bronchitis. Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis.
Viruses spread mainly from person to person by droplets produced when an ill person coughs, sneezes or talks and you inhale the droplets. Viruses may also spread through contact with an infected object. This happens when you touch something with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, eyes or nose.
The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition.

## Risk factors
Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include:
- Cigarette smoke.People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.
- Low resistance.This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection.
- Exposure to irritants on the job.Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.
- Gastric reflux.Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis.

## Complications
Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn't cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

## Prevention
To reduce your risk of bronchitis, follow these tips:
- Get an annual flu shot.Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus. Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu. Also ask your doctor or clinic if you need a vaccination that protects against certain types of pneumonia.
- Wash your hands.To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
- Avoid close contact with people who have a viral infection.Stay away from people who have the flu or another respiratory illness.
- Avoid cigarette smoke.Cigarette smoke increases your risk of chronic bronchitis.
- Wear appropriate face covering.If you haveCOPD, consider wearing a face mask at work if you're exposed to dust or fumes. Talk to your employer about the appropriate protection. Wearing a face mask when you're going to be among crowds helps reduce exposure to infections.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: BRONCHITIS


## Diagnosis
During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe.
In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests:
- Chest X-ray.A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you smoke or have ever smoked.
- Sputum tests.Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies.
- Pulmonary function test.During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema.

## Treatment
Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks.

## Medications
In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including:
- Cough medicine.If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime.
- Other medications.If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs.
- Antibiotics.Because most cases of acute bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren't effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic.

## Therapies
If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from:
- Pulmonary rehabilitation.This is a breathing exercise program in which a respiratory therapist teaches you how to breathe more easily and increase your ability to be physically active.
- Oxygen therapy.This delivers extra oxygen to help you breathe.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
If you have bronchitis, to help you feel better, you may want to try the following self-care measures:
- Get enough rest.Rest and sleep help your body heal.
- Drink plenty of fluids.Staying hydrated can help to thin mucus.
- Avoid lung irritants.Don't smoke. Wear a mask when the air is polluted or if you're exposed to irritants, such as paint or household cleaners with strong fumes.
- Use a humidifier.Warm, moist air helps relieve coughs and loosens mucus in your airways. Be sure to clean the humidifier according to the manufacturer's recommendations to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi in the water container.
- Consider a face covering in cold air.If cold air makes your cough worse and causes shortness of breath, put on a face mask or cover your mouth and nose with a scarf before you go outside.

## Preparing for your appointment
You're likely to start by seeing your family doctor. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in lung diseases (pulmonologist).

## What you can do
Before your appointment, make a list of answers to the following questions:
- Have you recently had a cold or the flu?
- Have you ever had pneumonia?
- Do you have any other medical conditions?
- What medications, vitamins and supplements do you take regularly?
- Are you exposed to lung irritants at your job?
- Do you smoke or are you around tobacco smoke?
If possible, bring a family member or friend to your appointment. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
If you've ever seen another physician for your cough, tell your present doctor what tests were done. If possible, bring the reports with you, including results of a chest X-ray, sputum culture and pulmonary function test.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your healthcare professional is likely to ask you several questions, such as:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- Do your symptoms affect your sleep or work?
- Does anything improve or worsen your symptoms?
- Does cold air bother you?
- Do you notice that you wheeze sometimes?
- Have you had bronchitis before? Has it ever lasted more than three weeks?
- In between bouts of bronchitis, have you noticed that you're more short of breath than you were a year earlier?
- Do you exercise? Can you climb one flight of stairs without difficulty? Can you walk as fast as you used to?
- Do you smoke? If so, how much and for how long?
- Have you inhaled recreational drugs?
- Have you received the annual flu shot?
- Have you ever been vaccinated against pneumonia? If so, when?

DISEASE NAME: SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER (SOCIAL PHOBIA)


## Overview
It's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.
In social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.
Social anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.

## Symptoms
Feelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing.
In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults.
Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant:
- Fear of situations in which you may be judged negatively
- Worry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself
- Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers
- Fear that others will notice that you look anxious
- Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice
- Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment
- Avoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention
- Anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event
- Intense fear or anxiety during social situations
- Analysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation
- Expectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation
For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations.
Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations.
Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include:
- Blushing
- Fast heartbeat
- Trembling
- Sweating
- Upset stomach or nausea
- Trouble catching your breath
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Feeling that your mind has gone blank
- Muscle tension
Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including:
- Interacting with unfamiliar people or strangers
- Attending parties or social gatherings
- Going to work or school
- Starting conversations
- Making eye contact
- Dating
- Entering a room in which people are already seated
- Returning items to a store
- Eating in front of others
- Using a public restroom
Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment.
See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.

## Causes
Like many other mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors. Possible causes include:
- Inherited traits.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. However, it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learned behavior.
- Brain structure.A structure in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-luh) may play a role in controlling the fear response. People who have an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations.
- Environment.Social anxiety disorder may be a learned behavior — some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behavior in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children.

## Risk factors
Several factors can increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder, including:
- Family history.You're more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if your biological parents or siblings have the condition.
- Negative experiences.Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. In addition, other negative events in life, such as family conflict, trauma or abuse, may be associated with this disorder.
- Temperament.Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at greater risk.
- New social or work demands.Social anxiety disorder symptoms typically start in the teenage years, but meeting new people, giving a speech in public or making an important work presentation may trigger symptoms for the first time.
- Having an appearance or condition that draws attention.For example, facial disfigurement, stuttering or tremors due to Parkinson's disease can increase feelings of self-consciousness and may trigger social anxiety disorder in some people.

## Complications
Left untreated, social anxiety disorder can control your life. Anxieties can interfere with work, school, relationships or enjoyment of life. This disorder can cause:
- Low self-esteem
- Trouble being assertive
- Negative self-talk
- Hypersensitivity to criticism
- Poor social skills
- Isolation and difficult social relationships
- Low academic and employment achievement
- Substance abuse, such as drinking too much alcohol
- Suicide or suicide attempts
Other anxiety disorders and certain other mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and substance abuse problems, often occur with social anxiety disorder.

## Prevention
There's no way to predict what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:
- Get help early.Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.
- Keep a journal.Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.
- Set priorities in your life.You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy. Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy.
- Avoid unhealthy substance use.Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or find a treatment program or support group to help you.

DISEASE NAME: SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER (SOCIAL PHOBIA)


## Diagnosis
Your health care provider will want to determine whether other conditions may be causing your anxiety or if you have social anxiety disorder along with another physical or mental health disorder.
Your health care provider may determine a diagnosis based on:
- Physical exam to help assess whether any medical condition or medication may trigger symptoms of anxiety
- Discussion of your symptoms, how often they occur and in what situations
- Review of a list of situations to see if they make you anxious
- Self-report questionnaires about symptoms of social anxiety
- Criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association
DSM-5 criteria for social anxiety disorder include:
- Persistent, intense fear or anxiety about specific social situations because you believe you may be judged negatively, embarrassed or humiliated
- Avoidance of anxiety-producing social situations or enduring them with intense fear or anxiety
- Excessive anxiety that's out of proportion to the situation
- Anxiety or distress that interferes with your daily living
- Fear or anxiety that is not better explained by a medical condition, medication or substance abuse

## Treatment
Treatment depends on how much social anxiety disorder affects your ability to function in daily life. The most common treatment for social anxiety disorder includes psychotherapy (also called psychological counseling or talk therapy) or medications or both.

## Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy improves symptoms in most people with social anxiety disorder. In therapy, you learn how to recognize and change negative thoughts about yourself and develop skills to help you gain confidence in social situations.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective type of psychotherapy for anxiety, and it can be equally effective when conducted individually or in groups.
In exposure-based CBT, you gradually work up to facing the situations you fear most. This can improve your coping skills and help you develop the confidence to deal with anxiety-inducing situations. You may also participate in skills training or role-playing to practice your social skills and gain comfort and confidence relating to others. Practicing exposures to social situations is particularly helpful to challenge your worries.

## First choices in medications
Though several types of medications are available, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often the first type of drug tried for persistent symptoms of social anxiety. Your health care provider may prescribe paroxetine (Paxil) or sertraline (Zoloft).
The serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor XR) also may be an option for social anxiety disorder.
To reduce the risk of side effects, your health care provider may start you at a low dose of medication and gradually increase your prescription to a full dose. It may take several weeks to several months of treatment for your symptoms to noticeably improve.

## Other medications
Your health care provider may also prescribe other medications for symptoms of social anxiety, such as:
- Other antidepressants.You may have to try several different antidepressants to find the one that's most effective for you with the fewest side effects.
- Anti-anxiety medications.Benzodiazepines (ben-zoe-die-AZ-uh-peens) may reduce your level of anxiety. Although they often work quickly, they can be habit-forming and sedating, so they're typically prescribed for only short-term use.
- Beta blockers.These medications work by blocking the stimulating effect of epinephrine (adrenaline). They may reduce heart rate, blood pressure, pounding of the heart, and shaking voice and limbs. Because of that, they may work best when used infrequently to control symptoms for a particular situation, such as giving a speech. They're not recommended for general treatment of social anxiety disorder.

## Stick with it
Don't give up if treatment doesn't work quickly. You can continue to make strides in psychotherapy over several weeks or months. Learning new skills to help manage your anxiety takes time. And finding the right medication for your situation can take some trial and error.
For some people, the symptoms of social anxiety disorder may fade over time, and medication can be discontinued. Others may need to take medication for years to prevent a relapse.
To make the most of treatment, keep your medical or therapy appointments, challenge yourself by setting goals to approach social situations that cause you anxiety, take medications as directed, and talk to your health care provider about any changes in your condition.

## Alternative medicine
Several herbal remedies have been studied as treatments for anxiety, but results are mixed. Before taking any herbal remedies or supplements, talk with your health care team to make sure they're safe and won't interact with any medications you take.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Although social anxiety disorder generally requires help from a medical expert or qualified psychotherapist, you can try some of these techniques to handle situations that are likely to trigger symptoms:
- Learn stress-reduction skills.
- Get physical exercise or be physically active on a regular basis.
- Get enough sleep.
- Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.
- Avoid alcohol.
- Limit or avoid caffeine.
- Participate in social situations by reaching out to people with whom you feel comfortable.
First, consider your fears to identify what situations cause the most anxiety. Then gradually practice these activities until they cause you less anxiety. Begin with small steps by setting daily or weekly goals in situations that aren't overwhelming. The more you practice, the less anxious you'll feel.
Consider practicing these situations:
- Eat with a close relative, friend or acquaintance in a public setting.
- Purposefully make eye contact and return greetings from others, or be the first to say hello.
- Give someone a compliment.
- Ask a retail clerk to help you find an item.
- Get directions from a stranger.
- Show an interest in others — ask about their homes, children, grandchildren, hobbies or travels, for instance.
- Call a friend to make plans.
At first, being social when you're feeling anxious is challenging. As difficult or painful as it may seem initially, don't avoid situations that trigger your symptoms. By regularly facing these kinds of situations, you'll continue to build and reinforce your coping skills.
These strategies can help you begin to face situations that make you nervous:
- Prepare for conversation, for example, by reading about current events to identify interesting stories you can talk about.
- Focus on personal qualities you like about yourself.
- Practice relaxation exercises.
- Learn stress management techniques.
- Set realistic social goals.
- Pay attention to how often the embarrassing situations you're afraid of actually take place. You may notice that the scenarios you fear usually don't come to pass.
- When embarrassing situations do happen, remind yourself that your feelings will pass and you can handle them until they do. Most people around you either don't notice or don't care as much as you think, or they're more forgiving than you assume.
Avoid using alcohol to calm your nerves. It may seem like it helps temporarily, but in the long term it can make you feel even more anxious.

## Coping and support
These coping methods may help ease your anxiety:
- Routinely reach out to friends and family members.
- Join a local or reputable internet-based support group.
- Join a group that offers opportunities to improve communication and public speaking skills, such as Toastmasters International.
- Do pleasurable or relaxing activities, such as hobbies, when you feel anxious.
Over time, these coping methods can help control your symptoms and prevent a relapse. Remind yourself that you can get through anxious moments, that your anxiety is short-lived and that the negative consequences you worry about so much rarely come to pass.

## Preparing for your appointment
You may see your primary care provider, or your provider may refer you to a mental health professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
Before your appointment, make a list of:
- Situations you've been avoiding,especially those that are important to your functioning
- Any symptoms you've been experiencing,and for how long, including any symptoms that may seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment
- Key personal information,especially any significant events or changes in your life shortly before your symptoms appeared
- Medical information,including other physical or mental health conditions with which you've been diagnosed
- Any medications, vitamins, herbs or other supplementsyou're taking, including dosages
- Questionsto ask your health care provider or a mental health professional
You may want to ask a trusted family member or friend to go with you to your appointment, if possible, to help you remember key information.
Some questions to ask your health care provider may include:
- What do you believe is causing my symptoms?
- Are there any other possible causes?
- How will you determine my diagnosis?
- Should I see a mental health specialist?
- Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?
- Are effective treatments available for this condition?
- With treatment, could I eventually be comfortable in the situations that make me so anxious now?
- Am I at increased risk of other mental health problems?
- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your health care provider
Your health care provider or a mental health professional will likely ask you a number of questions. Be ready to answer them to reserve time to go over any points you want to focus on. Your health care provider may ask:
- Does fear of embarrassment cause you to avoid doing certain activities or speaking to people?
- Do you avoid activities in which you're the center of attention?
- Would you say that being embarrassed or looking stupid is among your worst fears?
- When did you first notice these symptoms?
- When are your symptoms most likely to occur?
- Does anything seem to make your symptoms better or worse?
- How are your symptoms affecting your life, including work and personal relationships?
- Do you ever have symptoms when you're not being observed by others?
- Have any of your close relatives had similar symptoms?
- Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
- Have you been treated for mental health symptoms or mental illness in the past? If yes, what type of therapy was most beneficial?
- Have you ever thought about harming yourself or others?
- Do you drink alcohol or use recreational drugs? If so, how often?

DISEASE NAME: ANXIETY DISORDERS


## Overview
Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).
These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood.
Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment.
Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help.

## Symptoms
Common anxiety signs and symptoms include:
- Feeling nervous, restless or tense
- Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom
- Having an increased heart rate
- Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation)
- Sweating
- Trembling
- Feeling weak or tired
- Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry
- Having trouble sleeping
- Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems
- Having difficulty controlling worry
- Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety
Several types of anxiety disorders exist:
- Agoraphobia(ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed.
- Anxiety disorder due to a medical conditionincludes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem.
- Generalized anxiety disorderincludes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression.
- Panic disorderinvolves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred.
- Selective mutismis a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning.
- Separation anxiety disorderis a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles.
- Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others.
- Specific phobiasare characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people.
- Substance-induced anxiety disorderis characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs.
- Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorderare terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.

## When to see a doctor
See your doctor if:
- You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life
- Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control
- You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety
- You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem
- You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately
Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.

## Causes
The causes of anxiety disorders aren't fully understood. Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. Inherited traits also can be a factor.

## Medical causes
For some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue. In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness. If your doctor suspects your anxiety may have a medical cause, he or she may order tests to look for signs of a problem.
Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include:
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism
- Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma
- Drug misuse or withdrawal
- Withdrawal from alcohol, anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) or other medications
- Chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome
- Rare tumors that produce certain fight-or-flight hormones
Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications.
It's possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if:
- You don't have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder
- You didn't have an anxiety disorder as a child
- You don't avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety
- You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn't have a previous history of anxiety

## Risk factors
These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder:
- Trauma.Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders.
- Stress due to an illness.Having a health condition or serious illness can cause significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future.
- Stress buildup.A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety — for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances.
- Personality.People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are.
- Other mental health disorders.People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder.
- Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder.Anxiety disorders can run in families.
- Drugs or alcohol.Drug or alcohol use or misuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety.

## Complications
Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as:
- Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders
- Substance misuse
- Trouble sleeping (insomnia)
- Digestive or bowel problems
- Headaches and chronic pain
- Social isolation
- Problems functioning at school or work
- Poor quality of life
- Suicide

## Prevention
There's no way to predict for certain what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:
- Get help early.Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.
- Stay active.Participate in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. Enjoy social interaction and caring relationships, which can lessen your worries.
- Avoid alcohol or drug use.Alcohol and drug use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: ANXIETY DISORDERS


## Diagnosis
You may start by seeing your primary care provider to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. He or she can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment.
However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy).
To help diagnose an anxiety disorder, your mental health provider may:
- Give you a psychological evaluation.This involves discussing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems — such as depression or substance misuse — which can make diagnosis more challenging.
- Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5.Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder.

## Treatment
The two main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you.

## Psychotherapy
Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety.
CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms.

## Medications
Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example:
- Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders.
- An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed.
- In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe other types of medications, such as sedatives, also called benzodiazepines, or beta blockers. These medications are for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and are not intended to be used long term.
Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do:
- Keep physically active.Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities.
- Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.These substances can cause or worsen anxiety. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you.
- Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking caffeinated beverages.Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety.
- Use stress management and relaxation techniques.Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety.
- Make sleep a priority.Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor.
- Eat healthy.Healthy eating — such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish — may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed.

## Alternative medicine
Several herbal remedies have been studied as a treatment for anxiety, but more research is needed to understand the risks and benefits. Herbal and dietary supplements aren't monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Some of these supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions.
Before taking herbal remedies or dietary supplements, talk to your doctor to make sure they're safe for you and won't interact with any medications you take.

## Coping and support
To cope with an anxiety disorder, here's what you can do:
- Learn about your disorder.Talk to your doctor or mental health provider. Find out what might be causing your specific condition and what treatments might be best for you. Involve your family and friends and ask for their support.
- Stick to your treatment plan.Take medications as directed. Keep therapy appointments and complete any assignments your therapist may give you. Consistency can make a big difference, especially when it comes to taking your medication.
- Take action.Learn what triggers your anxiety or causes you stress. Practice the strategies you developed with your mental health provider so you're ready to deal with anxious feelings in these situations.
- Keep a journal.Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health provider identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.
- Join an anxiety support group.Remember that you aren't alone. Support groups offer compassion, understanding and shared experiences. The National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America provide information on finding support.
- Learn time management techniques.You can reduce anxiety by learning how to carefully manage your time and energy.
- Socialize.Don't let worries isolate you from loved ones or activities.
- Break the cycle.When you feel anxious, take a brisk walk or delve into a hobby to refocus your mind away from your worries.

## Preparing for your appointment
You may start by seeing your primary care provider. He or she may refer you to a mental health professional.

## What you can do
Before your appointment, make a list of:
- Your anxiety symptoms.Note when they occur, whether anything seems to make them better or worse, and how much they affect your day-to-day activities and interactions.
- What causes you stress.Include any major life changes or stressful events you've dealt with recently. Also note any traumatic experiences you've had in the past or as a child.
- Any family history of mental health problems.Note if your parents, grandparents, siblings or children have struggled with any mental health problems.
- Any other health problems you have.Include both physical conditions and mental health issues.
- All medications you're taking.Include any medications, vitamins, herbs or other supplements, and the doses.
- Questions to ask your doctorto make the most of your appointment.
Some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
- What's the most likely cause of my anxiety?
- Are there other possible situations, psychological issues or physical health problems that could be causing or worsening my anxiety?
- Do I need any tests?
- Should I see a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health provider?
- What type of therapy might help me?
- Would medication help? If so, is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
- In addition to treatment, are there any steps I can take at home that might help?
- Do you have any educational materials that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor will likely ask you several questions, such as:
- What are your symptoms, and how severe are they? How do they impact your ability to function?
- Have you ever had a panic attack?
- Do you avoid certain things or situations because they make you anxious?
- Have your feelings of anxiety been occasional or continuous?
- When did you first begin noticing your feelings of anxiety?
- Does anything in particular seem to trigger your anxiety or make it worse?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your feelings of anxiety?
- What traumatic experiences have you had recently or in the past?
- What, if any, physical or mental health conditions do you have?
- Do you take any prescription drugs?
- Do you regularly drink alcohol or use recreational drugs?
- Do you have any blood relatives who have anxiety or other mental health conditions, such as depression?
Preparing and anticipating questions will help you make the most of your time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: DEPRESSION (MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER)


## Overview
Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.

## Symptoms
Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:
- Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness
- Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
- Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports
- Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much
- Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
- Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain
- Anxiety, agitation or restlessness
- Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements
- Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
- Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
- Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide
- Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches
For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.

## Depression symptoms in children and teens
Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.
- In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.
- In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.

## Depression symptoms in older adults
Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:
- Memory difficulties or personality changes
- Physical aches or pain
- Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication
- Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things
- Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men

## When to see a doctor
If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.

## When to get emergency help
If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 in the U.S. or your local emergency number immediately.
Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:
- Call your doctor or mental health professional.
- Contact a suicide hotline.
- In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, available24 hours a day, seven days a week. Or use theLifeline Chat. Services are free and confidential.
- U.S. veterans or service members who are in crisis can call 988 and then press “1” for theVeterans Crisis Line. Or text 838255. Orchat online.
- The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free).
- Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
- Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.
If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

## Causes
It's not known exactly what causes depression. As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as:
- Biological differences.People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
- Brain chemistry.Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.
- Hormones.Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression. Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions.
- Inherited traits.Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.

## Risk factors
Depression often begins in the teens, 20s or 30s, but it can happen at any age. More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment.
Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include:
- Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic
- Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems
- Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide
- Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation
- History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder
- Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs
- Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease
- Certain medications, such as some high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills (talk to your doctor before stopping any medication)

## Complications
Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life.
Examples of complications associated with depression include:
- Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes
- Pain or physical illness
- Alcohol or drug misuse
- Anxiety, panic disorder or social phobia
- Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems
- Social isolation
- Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide
- Self-mutilation, such as cutting
- Premature death from medical conditions

## Prevention
There's no sure way to prevent depression. However, these strategies may help.
- Take steps to control stress,to increase your resilience and boost your self-esteem.
- Reach out to family and friends,especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.
- Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problemto help prevent depression from worsening.
- Consider getting long-term maintenance treatmentto help prevent a relapse of symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: DEPRESSION (MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER)


## Diagnosis
Your doctor may determine a diagnosis of depression based on:
- Physical exam.Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.
- Lab tests.For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count or test your thyroid to make sure it's functioning properly.
- Psychiatric evaluation.Your mental health professional asks about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.
- DSM-5.Your mental health professional may use the criteria for depression listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.

## Types of depression
Symptoms caused by major depression can vary from person to person. To clarify the type of depression you have, your doctor may add one or more specifiers. A specifier means that you have depression with specific features, such as:
- Anxious distress— depression with unusual restlessness or worry about possible events or loss of control
- Mixed features— simultaneous depression and mania, which includes elevated self-esteem, talking too much and increased energy
- Melancholic features— severe depression with lack of response to something that used to bring pleasure and associated with early morning awakening, worsened mood in the morning, major changes in appetite, and feelings of guilt, agitation or sluggishness
- Atypical features— depression that includes the ability to temporarily be cheered by happy events, increased appetite, excessive need for sleep, sensitivity to rejection, and a heavy feeling in the arms or legs
- Psychotic features— depression accompanied by delusions or hallucinations, which may involve personal inadequacy or other negative themes
- Catatonia— depression that includes motor activity that involves either uncontrollable and purposeless movement or fixed and inflexible posture
- Peripartum onset— depression that occurs during pregnancy or in the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum)
- Seasonal pattern— depression related to changes in seasons and reduced exposure to sunlight

## Other disorders that cause depression symptoms
Several other disorders, such as those below, include depression as a symptom. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis, so you can get appropriate treatment.
- Bipolar I and II disorders.These mood disorders include mood swings that range from highs (mania) to lows (depression). It's sometimes difficult to distinguish between bipolar disorder and depression.
- Cyclothymic disorder.Cyclothymic (sy-kloe-THIE-mik) disorder involves highs and lows that are milder than those of bipolar disorder.
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.This mood disorder in children includes chronic and severe irritability and anger with frequent extreme temper outbursts. This disorder typically develops into depressive disorder or anxiety disorder during the teen years or adulthood.
- Persistent depressive disorder.Sometimes called dysthymia (dis-THIE-me-uh), this is a less severe but more chronic form of depression. While it's usually not disabling, persistent depressive disorder can prevent you from functioning normally in your daily routine and from living life to its fullest.
- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder.This involves depression symptoms associated with hormone changes that begin a week before and improve within a few days after the onset of your period, and are minimal or gone after completion of your period.
- Other depression disorders.This includes depression that's caused by the use of recreational drugs, some prescribed medications or another medical condition.

## Treatment
Medications and psychotherapy are effective for most people with depression. Your primary care doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to relieve symptoms. However, many people with depression also benefit from seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional.
If you have severe depression, you may need a hospital stay, or you may need to participate in an outpatient treatment program until your symptoms improve.
Here's a closer look at depression treatment options.

## Medications
Many types of antidepressants are available, including those below. Be sure to discuss possible major side effects with your doctor or pharmacist.
- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).Doctors often start by prescribing an SSRI. These drugs are considered safer and generally cause fewer bothersome side effects than other types of antidepressants. SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft) and vilazodone (Viibryd).
- Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and levomilnacipran (Fetzima).
- Atypical antidepressants.These medications don't fit neatly into any of the other antidepressant categories. They include bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Wellbutrin SR, Aplenzin, Forfivo XL), mirtazapine (Remeron), nefazodone, trazodone and vortioxetine (Trintellix).
- Tricyclic antidepressants.These drugs — such as imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil) — can be very effective, but tend to cause more-severe side effects than newer antidepressants. So tricyclics generally aren't prescribed unless you've tried an SSRI first without improvement.
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).MAOIs — such as tranylcypromine (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil) and isocarboxazid (Marplan) — may be prescribed, typically when other drugs haven't worked, because they can have serious side effects. Using MAOIs requires a strict diet because of dangerous (or even deadly) interactions with foods — such as certain cheeses, pickles and wines — and some medications and herbal supplements. Selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that sticks on the skin as a patch, may cause fewer side effects than other MAOIs do. These medications can't be combined with SSRIs.
- Other medications.Other medications may be added to an antidepressant to enhance antidepressant effects. Your doctor may recommend combining two antidepressants or adding medications such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Anti-anxiety and stimulant medications also may be added for short-term use.

## Finding the right medication
If a family member has responded well to an antidepressant, it may be one that could help you. Or you may need to try several medications or a combination of medications before you find one that works. This requires patience, as some medications need several weeks or longer to take full effect and for side effects to ease as your body adjusts.
Inherited traits play a role in how antidepressants affect you. In some cases, where available, results of genetic tests (done by a blood test or cheek swab) may offer clues about how your body may respond to a particular antidepressant. However, other variables besides genetics can affect your response to medication.

## Risks of abruptly stopping medication
Don't stop taking an antidepressant without talking to your doctor first. Antidepressants aren't considered addictive, but sometimes physical dependence (which is different from addiction) can occur.
Stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms, and quitting suddenly may cause a sudden worsening of depression. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose.

## Antidepressants and pregnancy
If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, some antidepressants may pose an increased health risk to your unborn child or nursing child. Talk with your doctor if you become pregnant or you're planning to become pregnant.

## Antidepressants and increased suicide risk
Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants to carry a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under age 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
Anyone taking an antidepressant should be watched closely for worsening depression or unusual behavior, especially when starting a new medication or with a change in dosage. If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts when taking an antidepressant, immediately contact a doctor or get emergency help.
Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.

## Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy or psychological therapy.
Different types of psychotherapy can be effective for depression, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. Your mental health professional may also recommend other types of therapies. Psychotherapy can help you:
- Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty
- Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones
- Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others
- Find better ways to cope and solve problems
- Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse
- Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger
- Learn to set realistic goals for your life
- Develop the ability to tolerate and accept distress using healthier behaviors

## Alternate formats for therapy
Formats for depression therapy as an alternative to face-to-face office sessions are available and may be an effective option for some people. Therapy can be provided, for example, as a computer program, by online sessions, or using videos or workbooks. Programs can be guided by a therapist or be partially or totally independent.
Before you choose one of these options, discuss these formats with your therapist to determine if they may be helpful for you. Also, ask your therapist if he or she can recommend a trusted source or program. Some may not be covered by your insurance and not all developers and online therapists have the proper credentials or training.
Smartphones and tablets that offer mobile health apps, such as support and general education about depression, are not a substitute for seeing your doctor or therapist.

## Hospital and residential treatment
In some people, depression is so severe that a hospital stay is needed. This may be necessary if you can't care for yourself properly or when you're in immediate danger of harming yourself or someone else. Psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe until your mood improves.
Partial hospitalization or day treatment programs also may help some people. These programs provide the outpatient support and counseling needed to get symptoms under control.

## Other treatment options
For some people, other procedures, sometimes called brain stimulation therapies, may be suggested:
- Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).In ECT, electrical currents are passed through the brain to impact the function and effect of neurotransmitters in your brain to relieve depression. ECT is usually used for people who don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons or are at high risk of suicide.
- Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).TMS may be an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. During TMS, a treatment coil placed against your scalp sends brief magnetic pulses to stimulate nerve cells in your brain that are involved in mood regulation and depression.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Depression generally isn't a disorder that you can treat on your own. But in addition to professional treatment, these self-care steps can help:
- Stick to your treatment plan.Don't skip psychotherapy sessions or appointments. Even if you're feeling well, don't skip your medications. If you stop, depression symptoms may come back, and you could also experience withdrawal-like symptoms. Recognize that it will take time to feel better.
- Learn about depression.Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. Encourage your family to learn about depression to help them understand and support you.
- Pay attention to warning signs.Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your depression symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if your symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. Ask relatives or friends to help watch for warning signs.
- Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.It may seem like alcohol or drugs lessen depression symptoms, but in the long run they generally worsen symptoms and make depression harder to treat. Talk with your doctor or therapist if you need help with alcohol or substance use.
- Take care of yourself.Eat healthy, be physically active and get plenty of sleep. Consider walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or another activity that you enjoy. Sleeping well is important for both your physical and mental well-being. If you're having trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor about what you can do.

## Alternative medicine
Alternative medicine is the use of a nonconventional approach instead of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine is a nonconventional approach used along with conventional medicine — sometimes called integrative medicine.
Make sure you understand the risks as well as possible benefits if you pursue alternative or complementary therapy. Don't replace conventional medical treatment or psychotherapy with alternative medicine. When it comes to depression, alternative treatments aren't a substitute for medical care.

## Supplements
Examples of supplements that are sometimes used for depression include:
- St. John's wort.Although this herbal supplement isn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat depression in the U.S., it may be helpful for mild or moderate depression. But if you choose to use it, be careful — St. John's wort can interfere with a number of medications, such as heart drugs, blood-thinning drugs, birth control pills, chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS medications and drugs to prevent organ rejection after a transplant. Also, avoid taking St. John's wort while taking antidepressants because the combination can cause serious side effects.
- SAMe.Pronounced "sam-E," this dietary supplement is a synthetic form of a chemical that occurs naturally in the body. The name is short for S-adenosylmethionine (es-uh-den-o-sul-muh-THIE-o-neen). SAMe isn't approved by the FDA to treat depression in the U.S. It may be helpful, but more research is needed. SAMe may trigger mania in people with bipolar disorder.
- Omega-3 fatty acids.These healthy fats are found in cold-water fish, flaxseed, flax oil, walnuts and some other foods. Omega-3 supplements are being studied as a possible treatment for depression. While considered generally safe, in high doses, omega-3 supplements may interact with other medications. More research is needed to determine if eating foods with omega-3 fatty acids can help relieve depression.
Nutritional and dietary products aren't monitored by the FDA the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Also, because some herbal and dietary supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any supplements.

## Mind-body connections
Integrative medicine practitioners believe the mind and body must be in harmony for you to stay healthy. Examples of mind-body techniques that may be helpful for depression include:
- Acupuncture
- Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi
- Meditation
- Guided imagery
- Massage therapy
- Music or art therapy
- Spirituality
- Aerobic exercise
Relying solely on these therapies is generally not enough to treat depression. They may be helpful when used in addition to medication and psychotherapy.

## Coping and support
Talk with your doctor or therapist about improving your coping skills, and try these tips:
- Simplify your life.Cut back on obligations when possible, and set reasonable goals for yourself. Give yourself permission to do less when you feel down.
- Write in a journal.Journaling, as part of your treatment, may improve mood by allowing you to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions.
- Read reputable self-help books and websites.Your doctor or therapist may be able to recommend books or websites to read.
- Locate helpful groups.Many organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, offer education, support groups, counseling and other resources to help with depression. Employee assistance programs and religious groups also may offer help for mental health concerns.
- Don't become isolated.Try to participate in social activities, and get together with family or friends regularly. Support groups for people with depression can help you connect to others facing similar challenges and share experiences.
- Learn ways to relax and manage your stress.Examples include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga and tai chi.
- Structure your time.Plan your day. You may find it helps to make a list of daily tasks, use sticky notes as reminders or use a planner to stay organized.
- Don't make important decisions when you're down.Avoid decision-making when you're feeling depressed, since you may not be thinking clearly.

## Preparing for your appointment
You may see your primary care doctor, or your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
Before your appointment, make a list of:
- Any symptoms you've had,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment
- Key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes
- All medications, vitamins or other supplementsthat you're taking, including dosages
- Questions to askyour doctor or mental health professional
Take a family member or friend along, if possible, to help you remember all of the information provided during the appointment.
Some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
- Is depression the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- What are other possible causes for my symptoms?
- What kinds of tests will I need?
- What treatment is likely to work best for me?
- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?
- Should I see a psychiatrist or other mental health professional?
- What are the main side effects of the medications you're recommending?
- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor will likely ask you a number of questions. Be ready to answer them to reserve time to go over any points you want to focus on. Your doctor may ask:
- When did you or your loved ones first notice your symptoms of depression?
- How long have you felt depressed? Do you generally always feel down, or does your mood fluctuate?
- Does your mood ever swing from feeling down to feeling intensely happy (euphoric) and full of energy?
- Do you ever have suicidal thoughts when you're feeling down?
- Do your symptoms interfere with your daily life or relationships?
- Do you have any blood relatives with depression or another mood disorder?
- What other mental or physical health conditions do you have?
- Do you drink alcohol or use recreational drugs?
- How much do you sleep at night? Does it change over time?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?

DISEASE NAME: MIGRAINE


## Overview
A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so bad that it interferes with your daily activities.
For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache. An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful. The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help.

## Symptoms
Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages.

## Prodrome
One or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:
- Constipation.
- Mood changes, from depression to euphoria.
- Food cravings.
- Neck stiffness.
- Increased urination.
- Fluid retention.
- Frequent yawning.

## Aura
For some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines. Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system. They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances. Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes.
Examples of migraine auras include:
- Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light.
- Vision loss.
- Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg.
- Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body.
- Difficulty speaking.

## Attack
A migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. How often migraines occur varies from person to person. Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month.
During a migraine, you might have:
- Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides.
- Pain that throbs or pulses.
- Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch.
- Nausea and vomiting.

## Post-drome
After a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day. Some people report feeling elated. Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly.

## When to see a doctor
Migraines are often undiagnosed and untreated. If you regularly have signs and symptoms of migraine, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them. Then make an appointment with your health care provider to discuss your headaches.
Even if you have a history of headaches, see your health care provider if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.
See your health care provider immediately or go to the emergency roomif you have any of the following signs and symptoms, which could indicate a more serious medical problem:
- An abrupt, severe headache like a thunderclap.
- Headache with fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, double vision, numbness or weakness in any part of the body, which could be a sign of a stroke.
- Headache after a head injury.
- A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement.
- New headache pain after age 50.

## Causes
Though migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role.
Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved. So might imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system.
Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines. Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

## Migraine triggers
There are a number of migraine triggers, including:
- Hormonal changes in women.Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women.Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines. Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications.

Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines. Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications.
- Drinks.These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee.
- Stress.Stress at work or home can cause migraines.
- Sensory stimuli.Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds. Strong smells — such as perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others — trigger migraines in some people.
- Sleep changes.Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people.
- Physical strain.Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines.
- Weather changes.A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine.
- Medications.Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.
- Foods.Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines. So might skipping meals.
- Food additives.These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods.

## Risk factors
Several factors make you more prone to having migraines, including:
- Family history.If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too.
- Age.Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence. Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades.
- Sex.Women are three times more likely than men to have migraines.
- Hormonal changes.For women who have migraines, headaches might begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation. They might also change during pregnancy or menopause. Migraines generally improve after menopause.

## Complications
Taking painkillers too often can trigger serious medication-overuse headaches. The risk seems to be highest with aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and caffeine combinations. Overuse headaches may also occur if you take aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for more than 14 days a month or triptans, sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) or rizatriptan (Maxalt) for more than nine days a month.
Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches. You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle.

## Headache & Migraine Discussions

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: MIGRAINE


## Diagnosis
If you have migraines or a family history of migraines, a specialist trained in treating headaches, known as a neurologist, will likely diagnose migraines based on your medical history, symptoms, and a physical and neurological examination.
If your condition is unusual, complex or suddenly becomes severe, tests to rule out other causes for your pain might include:
- AnMRIscan.A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and blood vessels.MRIscans help diagnose tumors, strokes, bleeding in the brain, infections, and other brain and nervous system, known as neurological, conditions.
- ACTscan.A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a series of X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the brain. This helps  diagnose tumors, infections, brain damage, bleeding in the brain and other possible medical problems that may be causing headaches.

## Treatment
Migraine treatment is aimed at stopping symptoms and preventing future attacks.
Many medications have been designed to treat migraines. Medications used to combat migraines fall into two broad categories:
- Pain-relieving medications.Also known as acute or abortive treatment, these types of drugs are taken during migraine attacks and are designed to stop symptoms.
- Preventive medications.These types of drugs are taken regularly, often daily, to reduce the severity or frequency of migraines.
Your treatment choices depend on the frequency and severity of your headaches, whether you have nausea and vomiting with your headaches, how disabling your headaches are, and other medical conditions you have.

## Medications for relief
Medications used to relieve migraine pain work best when taken at the first sign of an oncoming migraine — as soon as symptoms of a migraine begin.  Medications that can be used to treat it include:
- Pain relievers.These over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers include aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). When taken too long, these might cause medication-overuse headaches, and possibly ulcers and bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.Migraine relief medications that combine caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen (Excedrin Migraine) may be helpful, but usually only against mild migraine pain.

Migraine relief medications that combine caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen (Excedrin Migraine) may be helpful, but usually only against mild migraine pain.
- Triptans.Prescription drugs such as sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) and rizatriptan (Maxalt, Maxalt-MLT) are used to treat migraine because they block pain pathways in the brain. Taken as pills, shots or nasal sprays, they can relieve many symptoms of migraine. They might not be safe for those at risk of a stroke or heart attack.
- Dihydroergotamine (Migranal, Trudhesa).Available as a nasal spray or injection, this drug is most effective when taken shortly after the start of migraine symptoms for migraines that tend to last longer than 24 hours. Side effects can include worsening of migraine-related vomiting and nausea.People with coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease should avoid dihydroergotamine.

People with coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease should avoid dihydroergotamine.
- Lasmiditan (Reyvow).This newer oral tablet is approved for the treatment of migraine with or without aura. In drug trials, lasmiditan significantly improved headache pain. Lasmiditan can have a sedative effect and cause dizziness, so people taking it are advised not to drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours.
- Oral calcitonin gene-related peptides antagonists, known as gepants.Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) and rimegepant (Nurtec ODT) are oral gepants approved for the treatment of migraine in adults. In drug trials, medicines from this class were more effective than placebo at relieving pain two hours after taking them. They also were effective at treating migraine symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Common side effects include dry mouth, nausea and too much sleepiness. Ubrogepant and rimegepant should not be taken with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medicines such as some medicines used to treat cancer.
- Intranasal zavegepant (Zavzpret).The Food and Drug Administration recently approved this nasal spray to treat migraines. Zavegepant is a gepant and the only migraine medicine that comes as a nasal spray. It brings migraine pain relief within 15 minutes to 2 hours after taking a single dose. The medicine continues working for up to 48 hours. It also can improve other symptoms related to migraine, such as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.Common side effects of zavegepant include a change in sense of taste, nasal discomfort and throat irritation.

Common side effects of zavegepant include a change in sense of taste, nasal discomfort and throat irritation.
- Opioid medications.For people who can't take other migraine medications, narcotic opioid medications might help. Because they can be highly addictive, these are usually used only if no other treatments are effective.
- Anti-nausea drugs.These can help if your migraine with aura is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Anti-nausea drugs include chlorpromazine, metoclopramide (Gimoti, Reglan) or prochlorperazine (Compro, Compazine). These are usually taken with pain medications.
Some of these medications are not safe to take during pregnancy. If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, don't use any of these medications without first talking with your health care provider.

## Preventive medications
Medications can help prevent frequent migraines. Your health care provider might recommend preventive medications if you have frequent, long-lasting or severe headaches that don't respond well to treatment.
Preventive medication is aimed at reducing how often you get a migraine, how severe the attacks are and how long they last. Options include:
- Blood pressure-lowering medications.These include beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal, InnoPran), Hemangeol) and metoprolol (Lopressor). Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Verelan, Calan) can be helpful in preventing migraines with aura.
- Antidepressants.A tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline, can prevent migraines. Because of the side effects of amitriptyline, such as sleepiness, other antidepressants might be prescribed instead.
- Anti-seizure drugs.Valproate and topiramate (Topamax, Qudexy, others) might help if you have less frequent migraines, but can cause side effects such as dizziness, weight changes, nausea and more. These medications are not recommended for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
- Botox injections.Injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) about every 12 weeks help prevent migraines in some adults.
- Calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies.Erenumab-aooe (Aimovig), fremanezumab-vfrm (Ajovy), galcanezumab-gnlm (Emgality), and eptinezumab-jjmr (Vyepti) are newer medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat migraines. They're given monthly or quarterly by injection. The most common side effect is a reaction at the injection site.
- Atogepant (Qulipta).This medicine is a gepant that helps prevent migraines. It's a tablet taken by mouth daily. Potential side effects of the medicine may include nausea, constipation and fatigue.
- Rimegepant (Nurtec ODT).This medicine is unique in that it's a gepant that helps prevent migraines in addition to treating migraines as needed.
Ask your health care provider if these medications are right for you. Some of these medications are not safe to take during pregnancy. If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, don't use any of these medications without first talking with your provider.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
When symptoms of migraine start, try heading to a quiet, darkened room. Close your eyes and rest or take a nap. Place a cool cloth or ice pack wrapped in a towel or cloth on your forehead and drink lots of water.
These practices might also soothe migraine pain:
- Try relaxation techniques.Biofeedback and other forms of relaxation training teach you ways to deal with stressful situations, which might help reduce the number of migraines you have.
- Develop a sleeping and eating routine.Don't sleep too much or too little. Set and follow a consistent sleep and wake schedule daily. Try to eat meals at the same time every day.
- Drink plenty of fluids.Staying hydrated, particularly with water, might help.
- Keep a headache diary.Recording your symptoms in a headache diary will help you learn more about what triggers your migraines and what treatment is most effective. It will also help your health care provider diagnose your condition and track your progress in between visits.
- Exercise regularly.Regular aerobic exercise reduces tension and can help prevent a migraine. If your care provider agrees, choose aerobic activity you enjoy, such as walking, swimming and cycling. Warm up slowly, however, because sudden, intense exercise can cause headaches.Regular exercise can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy body weight, and obesity is thought to be a factor in migraines.

## Alternative medicine
Nontraditional therapies might help with chronic migraine pain.
- Acupuncture.Clinical trials have found that acupuncture may be helpful for headache pain. In this treatment, a practitioner inserts many thin, disposable needles into several areas of your skin at defined points.
- Biofeedback.Biofeedback appears to be effective in relieving migraine pain. This relaxation technique uses special equipment to teach you how to monitor and control certain physical responses related to stress, such as muscle tension.
- Cognitive behavioral therapy.Cognitive behavioral therapy may benefit some people with migraines. This type of psychotherapy teaches you how behaviors and thoughts affect how you perceive pain.
- Meditation and yoga.Meditation may relieve stress, which is a known trigger of migraines. Done on a regular basis, yoga may reduce the frequency and duration of migraines.
- Herbs, vitamins and minerals.There is some evidence that the herbs feverfew and butterbur might prevent migraines or reduce their severity, though study results are mixed. Butterbur isn't recommended because of safety concerns.A high dose of riboflavin (vitamin B-2) may reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. Coenzyme Q10 supplements might decrease the frequency of migraines, but larger studies are needed.Magnesium supplements have been used to treat migraines, but with mixed results.

## Preparing for your appointment
You'll probably first see a primary care provider, who might then refer you to a provider trained in evaluating and treating headaches, called a neurologist.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
- Keep track of your symptoms.Keep a headache diary by writing a description of each incident of visual disturbances or unusual sensations, including when they occurred, how long they lasted and what triggered them. A headache diary can help diagnose your condition.
- Write down key personal information,including major stresses or recent life changes.
- Make a list of all medications,vitamins or supplements you take, including doses. It's particularly important to list all medications you've used to treat your headaches.
- Write down questions to askyour health care provider.
Take a family member or friend along, if possible, to help you remember the information you receive.
For migraines, questions to ask your care provider include:
- What is likely triggering my migraines?
- Are there other possible causes for my migraine symptoms?
- What tests do I need?
- Are my migraines likely temporary or chronic?
- What is the best course of action?
- What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
- What changes to my lifestyle or diet do you suggest I make?
- I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there printed materials you can give me? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care provider is likely to ask you a number of questions, including:
- How often do your headaches occur?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?

DISEASE NAME: INSOMNIA


## Overview
Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. It also can cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake up. Insomnia can drain your energy level and affect your mood. It also can affect your health, work performance and quality of life.
How much sleep is enough varies from person to person. But most adults need 7 to 9 hours a night.
At some point, many adults have short-term insomnia. This can last for days or weeks. Short-term insomnia is usually due to stress or a distressing event. But some people have long-term insomnia, also called chronic insomnia. This lasts for three months or more. Insomnia may be the main problem, or it may be related to other medical conditions or medicines.
You do not have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits often can help.

## Symptoms
Insomnia symptoms may include:
- Having a hard time falling asleep at night.
- Waking up during the night.
- Waking up too early.
- Feeling tired or sleepy during the day.
- Feeling cranky, depressed or anxious.
- Having a hard time paying attention, focusing on tasks or remembering.
- Making more errors or having more accidents.
- Having ongoing worries about sleep.

## When to see a doctor
If insomnia makes it hard for you to do daily activities, see your doctor or another primary care professional. Your doctor will search for the cause of your sleep problem and help treat it. If it's thought that you could have a sleep disorder, your doctor might suggest going to a sleep center for special testing.

## Causes
Insomnia may be the main problem or it may be related to other conditions.
Long-term insomnia is usually due to stress, life events or habits that disrupt sleep. While treating the cause of your sleep problem may stop your insomnia, sometimes it can last for years.
Common causes of long-term insomnia include:
- Stress.Concerns about work, school, health, money or family can keep your mind active at night, making it hard to sleep. Stressful life events, such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss, also may lead to insomnia.
- Travel or work schedule.Your body's "internal clock," known as circadian rhythms, guides things such as your sleep-wake cycle, metabolism and body temperature. Disrupting these rhythms can lead to insomnia. Causes include feeling jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or changing shifts often.
- Poor sleep habits.Poor sleep habits include going to bed and waking up at different times each day, taking naps, being too active before bedtime and having a sleep area that is not comfortable. Other poor sleep habits include working, eating or watching TV while in bed. Using computers or smartphones, playing video games, or watching TV just before bed can disrupt your sleep cycle.
- Eating too much late in the evening.Having a light snack before bedtime is OK. But eating too much may cause you to feel uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also have heartburn. This is when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. This tube is called the esophagus. Heartburn may keep you awake.
- Mental health disorders.Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep. Waking up too early can be a sign of depression. Insomnia often occurs with other mental health conditions.
- Medicines.Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medicines for asthma or blood pressure. Many medicines available without a prescription, such as some pain medicines, allergy and cold medicines, and weight-loss products, contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep.
- Medical conditions.Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include ongoing pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
- Sleep-related disorders.Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing at times during the night, disrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes a strong uncomfortable urge to move your legs when trying to fall asleep. This may keep you from falling asleep or getting back to sleep.
- Caffeine, nicotine and alcohol.Coffee, tea, cola and other drinks that have caffeine are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can disrupt sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often results in waking up in the middle of the night.

## Insomnia and aging
Insomnia becomes more common with age. As you get older, you may:
- Change your sleep patterns.Sleep often becomes less restful as you age, so noise or other changes in your surroundings are more likely to wake you. With age, your internal clock often moves forward in time, so you get tired earlier in the evening and wake up earlier in the morning. But older people typically still need the same amount of sleep as younger people.
- Change your level of activity.You may be less physically or socially active. A lack of activity can disrupt a good night's sleep. Also, the less active you are, the more likely you may be to take a daily nap. Napping can disrupt sleep at night.
- Have changes in your health.Ongoing pain from conditions such as arthritis or back problems, as well as depression or anxiety, can disrupt sleep. Issues that make it more likely that you'll need to urinate during the night, such as prostate or bladder problems, can disrupt sleep. Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome become more common with age.
- Take more medicines.Older people typically use more prescription drugs than younger people do. This raises the chance of insomnia related to medicines.

## Insomnia in children and teens
Sleep problems may be a concern for children and teenagers too. But some children and teens simply have trouble getting to sleep or resist a regular bedtime because their internal clocks are more delayed. They want to go to bed later and sleep later in the morning.

## Risk factors
Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night. But you're more likely to have insomnia if:
- You're a woman.Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle and in menopause may play a role. During menopause, night sweats and hot flashes often disrupt sleep. Insomnia also is common during pregnancy.
- You're over 60.Because of changes in sleep patterns and health, it's more likely you'll have insomnia as you get older.
- You have a mental health or physical health condition.Many issues that affect your mental or physical health can disrupt sleep.
- You're under a lot of stress.Being stressed can cause short-term insomnia. Major or long-lasting stress can lead to long-term insomnia.
- You do not have a regular schedule.For example, changing shifts at work or traveling can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle.

## Complications
Sleep is as important to your health as a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Whatever is keeping you from sleeping, insomnia can affect you mentally and physically. People with insomnia report a lower quality of life compared with people who sleep well.
Complications of insomnia may include:
- Lower performance on the job or at school.
- Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents.
- Mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety or substance misuse.
- Higher risk or worsening of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease.

## Prevention
Good sleep habits like these can help prevent insomnia:
- Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.
- Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.
- Limit naps or do not nap at all.
- Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.
- Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.
- Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep.
- Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.

DISEASE NAME: INSOMNIA


## Diagnosis
Depending on your situation, the diagnosis of insomnia and the search for its cause may include:
- Physical exam.If the cause of insomnia is not known, your health care professional may do a physical exam to look for signs of medical problems that may be related to insomnia. At times, a blood test may be done to check for thyroid problems or other conditions that may be related to poor sleep.
- Sleep habits review.In addition to asking questions about your sleep, your doctor or other health care professional may have you complete a questionnaire to show your sleep-wake pattern and your level of daytime sleepiness. You also may be asked to keep a sleep diary for a couple of weeks.
- Sleep study.If the cause of your insomnia is not clear, or you have signs of another sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, you may need to spend a night at a sleep center. Tests are done to keep track of and record various body activities while you sleep. This includes brain waves, breathing, heartbeat, eye movements and body movements.

## Treatment
Changing sleep habits and taking care of any issues related to insomnia, such as stress, medical conditions or medicines, can result in restful sleep for many people. If these steps do not work, your doctor may recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medicines or both to improve relaxation and sleep.

## CBT for insomnia
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can help you control or stop negative thoughts and actions that keep you awake. It's usually recommended as the first treatment for people with insomnia. Typically,CBTis as effective or more effective than sleep medicines.
The cognitive part ofCBTteaches you to learn and change beliefs that affect your sleep. It can help you control or stop negative thoughts and worries that keep you awake. It also may involve ending the cycle of worrying so much about getting to sleep that you cannot fall asleep.
The behavioral part ofCBThelps you learn good sleep habits and stop behaviors that keep you from sleeping well.
Strategies include:
- Stimulus control therapy.This method helps train your mind and body to sleep better and not fight sleep. For example, you might be coached to set a regular time to go to bed and wake up, not nap, and use the bed only for sleep and sex. You also may be coached to leave the bedroom if you cannot go to sleep within 20 minutes, only returning when you're sleepy.
- Relaxation methods.Progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback and breathing exercises are ways to lower anxiety at bedtime. Practicing these methods can help you control your breathing, heart rate and muscle tension so that you can relax.
- Sleep restriction.With this method, you reduce the time you spend in bed and stop napping during the day, so you get less sleep. This makes you more tired the next night. Once your sleep improves, you gradually increase your time in bed.
- Remaining passively awake.Also called paradoxical intention, this strategy for learned insomnia aims to reduce your worry and anxiety about being able to get to sleep. You get in bed and try to stay awake rather than expect to fall asleep. This approach reduces your extreme focus on sleep and anxiety over not sleeping, making it easier to fall asleep.
- Light therapy.If you fall asleep too early and then wake up too early, you can use light to push back your internal clock. You can go outside when it's light outside in the evenings or you can use a light box. Talk to your doctor for advice.
Your doctor may recommend other strategies related to your lifestyle and sleep area to help you create habits that lead to sound sleep and daytime alertness.

## Prescription medicines
Prescription sleeping pills can help you get to sleep, stay asleep or both. Doctors generally do not recommend relying on prescription sleeping pills for more than a few weeks. And medicines should not be the only treatment. But several medicines are approved for long-term use.
It's not known how long medicines can be wisely used. Rather, medicines are prescribed on a case-by-case basis, with you and your doctor weighing the benefits and risks. In general, it's best to use the lowest effective dose and not use medicines for too long.
Options for treating those who are having trouble falling asleep are:
- Eszopiclone (Lunesta).
- Ramelteon (Rozerem).
- Temazepam (Restoril).
- Triazolam (Halcion).
- Zaleplon (Sonata).
- Zolpidem tartrate (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar).
Options for treating those who are having trouble staying asleep, waking too early or finding it hard to get back to sleep are:
- Doxepin hydrochloride (Silenor).
- Eszopiclone (Lunesta).
- Suvorexant (Belsomra).
- Temazepam (Restoril).
- Zolpidem tartrate (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar).
Prescription sleeping pills can have side effects, such as causing daytime grogginess and creating a higher risk of falling. They also can be habit-forming. If your doctor prescribes a medicine to help you sleep, ask for more information, including possible side effects and how long you can take it.

## Sleep aids available without a prescription
Sleep medicines available without a prescription contain antihistamines that can make you sleepy. These medicines are not for regular use. Talk to your doctor before you take these medicines, as antihistamines may cause side effects. Side effects may include daytime sleepiness, dizziness, confusion, problems with thinking and difficulty urinating. Side effects may be worse in older adults.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
No matter your age, insomnia typically can be treated. The key often lies in changes to your routine during the day and when you go to bed.
These tips may help:
- Follow a sleep schedule.Keep your bedtime and wake time the same every day, including on weekends.
- Stay active.Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep. Schedule exercise at least a few hours before you go to bed. Do not take part in activities that use a lot of energy too close to bedtime.
- Check your medicines.If you take medicines regularly, check with your doctor to see if they may be playing a part in your insomnia. Also, check the labels of products available without a prescription to see if they contain caffeine or other stimulants, such as pseudoephedrine.
- Limit or stop naps.Naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night. If you cannot get by without one, try to limit a nap to no more than 30 minutes. Also, do not nap after 3 p.m. if your regular sleep time is at night.
- Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.Caffeine, alcohol and nicotine can make it harder to sleep. This effect can last for several hours.
- Do not put up with pain.If a painful condition bothers you, talk to your doctor about which pain relievers may control pain while you sleep.
- Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.A light snack is fine and may help avoid heartburn. Drink less liquid before bedtime so that you will not have to urinate as often.
At bedtime:
- Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep.Only use your bedroom for sex or sleep. Keep it dark, quiet and at a comfortable temperature. Hide all clocks in your bedroom, including your watch and cellphone. That way, you do not worry about what time it is.
- Find ways to relax.Try to put your worries and planning aside when you get into bed. A warm bath or a massage before you go to bed can help prepare you for sleep. Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a hot bath, reading, listening to soft music, doing breathing exercises or yoga, or praying.
- Do not try too hard to sleep.The harder you try to sleep, the more awake you'll become. Read in another room until you become drowsy. Then go to bed to sleep. Do not go to bed too early, before you're sleepy.
- Get out of bed when you're not sleeping.Sleep as much as you need to feel rested. Then get out of bed. Do not stay in bed if you're not sleeping.

## Alternative medicine
Many people never visit their doctor or other health care provider for insomnia. They try to cope with sleeplessness on their own.
Some people try therapies such as:
- Melatonin.This supplement, which is available without a prescription, is marketed to help fight insomnia. It's generally considered safe to use melatonin for a few weeks. But there is no convincing evidence to prove that it effectively treats insomnia, and long-term safety is not known. Guidelines from The American Academy of Sleep Medicine advise doctors and mental health care professionals not to prescribe it.
- Valerian.This dietary supplement is sold as a sleep aid because it has a mildly sedating effect. It has not been well-studied. Discuss valerian with your doctor before trying it. Some people who have used high doses or used it long term may have had liver damage. But it's not clear if valerian caused the damage.
- Acupuncture.This therapy is commonly used to treat insomnia. But this therapy is generally not recommended due to a lack of evidence that it's beneficial.
- Yoga or tai chi.Some studies suggest that the regular practice of yoga or tai chi can improve sleep quality. But this therapy is generally not recommended due to a lack of evidence that it's beneficial.
- Meditation.Several small studies suggest that meditation along with conventional treatment may help improve sleep and reduce stress.

## Caution about herbal and dietary sleep aids
The Food and Drug Administration does not order manufacturers of dietary supplements and sleep aids to show that they work and are safe. Talk with your doctor before taking any products available without a prescription. Some products can be harmful, and some can cause harm if you're taking certain medicines.

## Preparing for your appointment
If you're having sleep problems, you'll likely start by talking to your primary care professional. Ask if there's anything you need to do before your appointment, such as keeping a sleep diary. Take your bed partner along, if possible. Your partner can give information about how much and how well you're sleeping.

## What you can do
Prepare for your appointment by making a list of:
- Your symptoms,including any that may not relate to the reason for the appointment.
- Personal information,including new or ongoing health problems, major stresses or recent life changes.
- All medicines you take,including medicines available without a prescription, vitamins, and herbal or other supplements, as well as the doses. Let your doctor know about anything you've taken to help you sleep.
- Questions to askyour doctor to make the most of your appointment time.
Basic questions to ask include:
- What is likely causing my insomnia?
- What's the best treatment?
- How can I create an ideal sleep environment?
- How can I manage insomnia with my other health conditions?
- Should I go to a sleep clinic or sleep specialist? Will my insurance cover it?
- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have?
- What websites do you recommend?
Do not hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor may ask you several questions.
Common questions about insomnia include:
- How often do you have trouble sleeping?
- When did the insomnia begin?
- How long does it take you to fall asleep?

DISEASE NAME: ACNE


## Overview
Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.
Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.

## Symptoms
Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition:
- Whiteheads (closed plugged pores)
- Blackheads (open plugged pores)
- Small red, tender bumps (papules)
- Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips
- Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules)
- Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions)
Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.

## When to see a doctor
If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist).
For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.
In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products.
Seek emergency medical helpif after using a skin product you experience:
- Faintness
- Difficulty breathing
- Swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue
- Tightness of the throat

## Causes
Four main factors cause acne:
- Excess oil (sebum) production
- Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells
- Bacteria
- Inflammation
Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.
The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.
Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.
Certain things may trigger or worsen acne:
- Hormonal changes.Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too.
- Certain medications.Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium.
- Diet.Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions.
- Stress.Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.

## Acne myths
These factors have little effect on acne:
- Chocolate and greasy foods.Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.
- Hygiene.Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.
- Cosmetics.Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.

## Complications
People with darker skin types are more likely than are people with lighter skin to experience these acne complications:
- Scars.Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed.
- Skin changes.After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred.

## Risk factors
Risk factors for acne include:
- Age.People of all ages can get acne, but it's most common in teenagers.
- Hormonal changes.Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy.
- Family history.Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too.
- Greasy or oily substances.You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams.
- Friction or pressure on your skin.This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.

DISEASE NAME: ACNE


## Treatment
If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:
- Control your acne
- Avoid scarring or other damage to your skin
- Make scars less noticeable
Acne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.
The treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.
Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.

## Topical medications
The most common topical prescription medications for acne are:
- Retinoids and retinoid-like drugs.Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with brown or Black skin. Adapalene may be tolerated best.

Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.
Topical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with brown or Black skin. Adapalene may be tolerated best.
- Antibiotics.These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.
- Azelaic acid and salicylic acid.Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.Salicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.

Salicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.
- Dapsone.Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.
Evidence is not strong in support of using zinc, sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sulfacetamide sodium or aluminum chloride in topical treatments for acne.

## Oral medications
- Antibiotics.For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria. Usually the first choice for treating acne is a tetracycline (minocycline, doxycycline) or a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin). A macrolide might be an option for people who can't take tetracyclines, including pregnant women and children under 8 years old.Oral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance. And they should be combined with other drugs, such as benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.Severe side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon. These drugs do increase your skin's sun sensitivity.

- Combined oral contraceptives.Four combined oral contraceptives are approved by theFDAfor acne therapy in women who also wish to use them for contraception. They are products that combine progestin and estrogen (Ortho Tri-Cyclen 21, Yaz, others). You may not see the benefit of this treatment for a few months, so using other acne medications with it for the first few weeks may help.Common side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.

Common side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.
- Anti-androgen agents.The drug spironolactone (Aldactone) may be considered for women and adolescent girls if oral antibiotics aren't helping. It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil-producing glands. Possible side effects include breast tenderness and painful periods.
- Isotretinoin.Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others) is a derivative of vitamin A. It may be prescribed for people whose moderate or severe acne hasn't responded to other treatments.Potential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects. All people receiving isotretinoin must participate in anFDA-approved risk management program. And they'll need to see their doctors regularly to monitor for side effects.

## Therapies
For some people, the following therapies might be helpful, either alone or in combination with medications.
- Light therapy.A variety of light-based therapies have been tried with some success. Most will require multiple visits to your doctor's office. Further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose.
- Chemical peel.This procedure uses repeated applications of a chemical solution, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid or retinoic acid. This treatment is for mild acne. It might improve the appearance of the skin, though the change is not long lasting and repeat treatments are usually needed.
- Drainage and extraction.Your doctor may use special tools to gently remove whiteheads and blackheads (comedos) or cysts that haven't cleared up with topical medications. This technique temporarily improves the appearance of your skin, but it might also cause scarring.
- Steroid injection.Nodular and cystic lesions can be treated by injecting a steroid drug into them. This therapy has resulted in rapid improvement and decreased pain. Side effects may include skin thinning and discoloration in the treated area.

## Treating children
Most studies of acne drugs have involved people 12 years of age or older. Increasingly, younger children are getting acne as well. TheFDAhas expanded the number of topical products approved for use in children. And guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology indicate that topical benzoyl peroxide, adapalene and tretinoin in preadolescent children are effective and don't cause increased risk of side effects.
If your child has acne, consider consulting a pediatric dermatologist. Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.

## Alternative medicine
Some alternative and integrative medicine approaches might be helpful in reducing acne:
- Tea tree oil.Gels containing at least 5% tea tree oil may be as effective as lotions containing 5% benzoyl peroxide, although tea tree oil might work more slowly. Possible side effects include minor itching, burning, redness and dryness, which make it a poor choice for people with rosacea.
- Brewer's yeast.A strain of brewer's yeast called Hansen CBS seems to help decrease acne when taken orally. It may cause gas (flatulence).
More research is needed to establish the potential effectiveness and long-term safety of these and other integrative approaches, such as biofeedback and ayurvedic compounds. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of specific treatments before you try them.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
You can try to avoid or control mild or moderate acne with nonprescription products, good basic skin care and other self-care techniques:
- Wash problem areas with a gentle cleanser.Twice a day, use your hands to wash your face with mild soap or a gentle cleanser (Cetaphil, Vanicream, others) and warm water. And be gentle if you're shaving affected skin.Avoid certain products, such as facial scrubs, astringents and masks. They tend to irritate the skin, which can worsen acne. Too much washing and scrubbing also can irritate the skin.

- Try over-the-counter acne products to dry excess oil and promote peeling.Look for products containing benzoyl peroxide and adapalene as the active ingredients. You might also try products containing salicylic acid, glycolic acid or alpha hydroxy acids. It may take a few weeks of using a product before you see any improvement.Creams are less irritating than gels or ointments. Nonprescription acne medications may cause initial side effects — such as redness, dryness and scaling — that often improve after the first month of using them.

- Avoid irritants.Oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hairstyling products or acne concealers can worsen acne. Instead, use products labeled water-based or noncomedogenic, which means they are less likely to cause acne.
- Protect your skin from the sun.For some people, the sun worsens the discoloration that sometimes lingers after the acne has cleared. And some acne medications make you more susceptible to sunburn. Check with your doctor to see if your medication is one of these. If it is, stay out of the sun as much as possible. Regularly use a nonoily (noncomedogenic) moisturizer that includes a sunscreen.
- Avoid friction or pressure on your skin.Protect your acne-prone skin from contact with items such as phones, helmets, tight collars or straps, and backpacks.
- Avoid touching or picking acne-prone areas.Doing so can trigger more acne or lead to infection or scarring.
- Shower after strenuous activities.Oil and sweat on your skin can lead to breakouts.

## Coping and support
Acne and acne scars can cause anxiety and may affect your social relationships and self-image. Sometimes it can help to talk with your family, a support group or a counselor.
Stress can worsen acne. Try to manage stress by getting enough sleep and practicing relaxation techniques.

## Preparing for your appointment
If you have acne that's not responding to self-care and over-the-counter treatments, make an appointment with your doctor. Early, effective treatment of acne reduces the risk of scarring and of lasting damage to your self-esteem. After an initial examination, your doctor may refer you to a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions (dermatologist).
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
- List your key medical information,such as other conditions you're dealing with and any prescription or over-the-counter products you're using, including vitamins and supplements.
- List key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes.
- List questions to askyour doctor. Creating your list of questions in advance can help you make the most of your time with your doctor.
Below are some basic questions to ask your doctor about acne. If any additional questions occur to you during your visit, don't hesitate to ask.
- What treatment approach do you recommend for me?
- If the first treatment doesn't work, what will you recommend next?
- What are the possible side effects of the medications you're prescribing?
- How long can I safely use the medications you're prescribing?
- How soon after beginning treatment might my symptoms start to improve?
- When will you see me again to evaluate whether my treatment is working?
- Is it safe to stop my medications if they don't seem to be working?
- What self-care steps might improve my symptoms?
- Do you recommend any changes to my diet?
- Do you recommend any changes to the over-the-counter products I'm using on my skin, including soaps, lotions, sunscreens and cosmetics?

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to talk about in-depth. Your doctor may ask:
- When did you first develop this problem?
- Does anything in particular seem to trigger an acne flare, such as stress or — in girls and women — your menstrual cycle?
- What medications are you taking, including over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as vitamins and supplements?
- In girls and women: Do you use oral contraceptives?
- In girls and women: Do you have regular menstrual periods?
- In girls and women: Are you pregnant, or do you plan to become pregnant soon?
- What types of soaps, lotions, sunscreens, hair products or cosmetics do you use?
- How is acne affecting your self-esteem and your confidence in social situations?
- Do you have a family history of acne?
- What treatments and self-care steps have you tried so far? Have any been effective?
- Have other family members had isotretinoin treatment or hormone therapy to treat their acne? Has it been effective?

DISEASE NAME: ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA)


## Overview
Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious.
People with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing food allergies, hay fever and asthma.
Moisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.

## Symptoms
Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include:
- Dry, cracked skin
- Itchiness (pruritus)
- Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
- Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
- Oozing and crusting
- Thickened skin
- Darkening of the skin around the eyes
- Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.

## When to see a doctor
Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:
- Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
- Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
- Has a skin infection — look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
- Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
Seek immediate medical attentionif you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.

## Causes
In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin's ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors — such as tobacco smoke.
In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin's barrier function.
A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.
Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn't contagious.

## Risk factors
The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.

## Complications
Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:
- Asthma and hay fever.Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
- Food allergies.People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
- Chronic itchy, scaly skin.A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
- Patches of skin that's darker or lighter than the surrounding area.This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
- Skin infections.Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
- Irritant hand dermatitis.This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
- Allergic contact dermatitis.This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
- Sleep problems.The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.
- Mental health conditions.Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.

## Prevention
Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:
- Moisturize your skin at least twice a day.Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.

Using petroleum jelly on your baby's skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.
- Take a daily bath or shower.Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
- Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser.Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean — no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
- Pat dry.After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).
The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.
Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:
- Rough wool fabric
- Dry skin
- Skin infection
- Heat and sweat
- Stress
- Cleaning products
- Dust mites and pet dander
- Mold
- Pollen
- Smoke from tobacco
- Cold and dry air
- Fragrances
- Other irritating chemicals
Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow's milk. Talk with your child's health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.
Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA)


## Diagnosis
To diagnose atopic dermatitis, your health care provider will likely talk with you about your symptoms, examine your skin and review your medical history. You may need tests to identify allergies and rule out other skin diseases.
If you think a certain food caused your child's rash, ask your health care provider about potential food allergies.

## Patch testing
Your doctor may recommend patch testing on your skin. In this test, small amounts of different substances are applied to your skin and then covered. During visits over the next few days, the doctor looks at your skin for signs of a reaction. Patch testing can help diagnose specific types of allergies causing your dermatitis.

## Treatment
Treatment of atopic dermatitis may start with regular moisturizing and other self-care habits. If these don't help, your health care provider might suggest medicated creams that control itching and help repair skin. These are sometimes combined with other treatments.
Atopic dermatitis can be persistent. You may need to try various treatments over months or years to control it. And even if treatment is successful, symptoms may return (flare).

## Medications
- Medicated products applied to the skin.Many options are available to help control itching and repair the skin. Products are available in various strengths and as creams, gels and ointments. Talk with your health care provider about the options and your preferences. Whatever you use, apply it as directed (often twice a day), before you moisturize. Overuse of a corticosteroid product applied to the skin may cause side effects, such as thinning skin.Creams or ointments with a calcineurin inhibitor might be a good option for those over age 2. Examples include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Apply it as directed, before you moisturize. Avoid strong sunlight when using these products.The Food and Drug Administration requires that these products have a black box warning about the risk of lymphoma. This warning is based on rare cases of lymphoma among people using topical calcineurin inhibitors. After 10 years of study, no causal relationship between these products and lymphoma and no increased risk of cancer have been found.

- Drugs to fight infection.Your health care provider may prescribe antibiotic pills to treat an infection.
- Pills that control inflammation.For more-severe eczema, your health care provider may prescribe pills to help control your symptoms. Options might include cyclosporine, methotrexate, prednisone, mycophenolate and azathioprine. These pills are effective but can't be used long term because of potential serious side effects.
- Other options for severe eczema.The injectable biologics (monoclonal antibodies) dupilumab (Dupixent) and tralokinumab (Adbry) might be options for people with moderate to severe disease who don't respond well to other treatment. Studies show that it's safe and effective in easing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is for people over age 6. Tralokinumab is for adults.

## Therapies
- Wet dressings.An effective, intensive treatment for severe eczema involves applying a corticosteroid ointment and sealing in the medication with a wrap of wet gauze topped with a layer of dry gauze. Sometimes this is done in a hospital for people with widespread lesions because it's labor intensive and requires nursing expertise. Or ask your health care provider about learning how to use this technique at home safely.
- Light therapy.This treatment is used for people who either don't get better with topical treatments or rapidly flare again after treatment. The simplest form of light therapy (phototherapy) involves exposing the affected area to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms use artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) and narrow band ultraviolet B (UVB) alone or with drugs.Though effective, long-term light therapy has harmful effects, including premature skin aging, changes in skin color (hyperpigmentation) and an increased risk of skin cancer. For these reasons, phototherapy is less commonly used in young children and is not given to infants. Talk with your health care provider about the pros and cons of light therapy.

- Counseling.If you're embarrassed or frustrated by your skin condition, it can help to talk with a therapist or other counselor.
- Relaxation, behavior modification and biofeedback.These approaches may help people who scratch out of habit.

## Baby eczema
Treatment for eczema in babies (infantile eczema) includes:
- Identifying and avoiding skin irritants
- Avoiding extreme temperatures
- Giving your baby a short bath in warm water and applying a cream or ointment while the skin is still damp
See your baby's health care provider if these steps don't improve the rash or it looks infected. Your baby might need a prescription medication to control the rash or treat an infection. Your health care provider might also recommend an oral antihistamine to help lessen the itch and cause drowsiness, which may be helpful for nighttime itching and discomfort. The type of antihistamine that causes drowsiness may negatively affect the school performance of some children.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Taking care of sensitive skin is the first step in treating atopic dermatitis and preventing flares. To help reduce itching and soothe inflamed skin, try these self-care measures:
- Moisturize your skin at least twice a day.Find a product or combination of products that works for you. You might try bath oils, creams, lotions, shea butter, ointments or sprays. For a child, the twice-a-day regimen might be an ointment before bedtime and a cream before school. Ointments are greasier and may sting less when applied. Choose products that are free of dyes, alcohols, fragrances and other ingredients that might irritate the skin. Allow the moisturizer to absorb into the skin before getting dressed.
- Apply an anti-itch cream to the affected area.A nonprescription cream containing at least 1% hydrocortisone can temporarily relieve the itch. Apply it no more than twice a day to the affected area before moisturizing. Once your reaction has improved, you may use this type of cream less often to prevent flares.
- Take an oral allergy or anti-itch medication.Options include nonprescription allergy medicines (antihistamines) — such as cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy) or fexofenadine (Allegra Allergy). Also, diphenhydramine (Benadryl, others) may be helpful if itching is severe. But it causes drowsiness, so it's better for bedtime. The type of antihistamine that causes drowsiness may negatively affect the school performance of some children.
- Don't scratch.Rather than scratching when you itch, try pressing on or patting the skin. Cover the itchy area if you can't keep from scratching it. Keep your nails trimmed. For children, it might help to trim their nails and have them wear socks or gloves at night.
- Take a daily bath or shower.Use warm, rather than hot, water. If you're taking a bath, sprinkle the water with colloidal oatmeal, which is finely ground oatmeal made for bathing (Aveeno, others). Soak for less than 10 minutes, then pat dry. Apply moisturizer while the skin is still damp (within three minutes).
- Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser.Choose one without dyes, alcohols or fragrances. Harsh soaps can wash away your skin's natural oils. Be sure to rinse off the cleanser completely.
- Take a bleach bath.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a bleach bath for relief from severe or frequent flares. Talk with your health care provider about whether this is a good option for you.A diluted-bleach bath decreases bacteria on the skin and related infections. Add 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of household bleach, not concentrated bleach, to a 40-gallon (151-liter) bathtub filled with warm water. Measurements are for a U.S.-standard-sized tub filled to the overflow drainage holes.Soak from the neck down or just the affected areas for 5 to10 minutes. Don't put the head under water. Rinse off the bleach water with tap water. Take a bleach bath 2 to 3 times a week.

- Use a humidifier.Hot, dry indoor air can parch sensitive skin and worsen itching and flaking. A portable home humidifier or a humidifier attached to your furnace adds moisture to the air inside your home.
- Wear cool, smooth-textured clothing.Avoiding clothing that's rough, tight or scratchy. Also, in hot weather or while exercising, choose lightweight clothing that lets your skin breathe. When washing your clothing, avoid harsh detergents and fabric softeners added during the drying cycle.
- Treat stress and anxiety.Stress and other emotional disorders can worsen atopic dermatitis. Being aware of stress and anxiety and taking steps to improve your emotional health may help your skin too.

## Alternative medicine
Many people with atopic dermatitis have tried alternative (integrative) medicine approaches to easing their symptoms. Some approaches are supported by clinical studies.
- Cannabinoids.When applied to skin, creams containing cannabinoids have been shown to ease itching and skin thickening. Several studies over more than 10 years showed some benefit.
- Natural oils.When added to bathwater, natural oils might help improve dry skin. Examples of such oils are soybean oil and mineral oil. Use caution with oils in a bathtub as they can make the tub slippery.
- Manuka honey.When applied to the skin, manuka honey has been shown to calm reactions on the skin. It has been used for centuries as an antimicrobial. Don't use in it on children under 1 year of age, as it carries the risk of infantile botulism.
- Acupuncture and acupressure.Several studies show that acupuncture and acupressure can reduce the itchiness of atopic dermatitis.
If you're considering alternative therapies, talk with your health care provider about their pros and cons.

## Coping and support
Atopic dermatitis can make you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious. It can be especially stressful, frustrating or embarrassing for adolescents and young adults. It can disrupt their sleep and even lead to depression.
Some people may find it helpful to talk with a therapist or other counselor, a family member, or a friend. Or it can be helpful to find a support group for people with eczema, who know what it's like to live with the condition.

## Preparing for your appointment
You're likely to start by seeing your primary care provider. Or you may see a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions (dermatologist) or allergies (allergist).
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## What you can do
- List your symptoms, when they occurred and how long they lasted.Also, it may help to list factors that triggered or worsened your symptoms — such as soaps or detergents, tobacco smoke, sweating, or long, hot showers.
- Make a list of all the medications,vitamins, supplements and herbs you're taking. Even better, take the original bottles and a list of the dosages and directions.
- List questions to ask your health care provider.Ask questions when you want something clarified.
For atopic dermatitis, some basic questions you might ask your health care provider include:
- What might be causing my symptoms?
- Are tests needed to confirm the diagnosis?
- What treatment do you recommend, if any?
- Is this condition temporary or chronic?
- Can I wait to see if the condition goes away on its own?
- What are the alternatives to the approach you're suggesting?
- What skin care routines do you recommend to improve my symptoms?

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care provider is likely to ask you a few questions. Being ready to answer them may free up time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your health care provider might ask:
- What are your symptoms and when did they start?
- Does anything seem to trigger your symptoms?
- Do you or any family members have allergies or asthma?
- Are you exposed to any possible irritants from your job or hobbies?
- Have you felt depressed or been under any unusual stress lately?
- Do you come in direct contact with pets or other animals?
- What products do you use on your skin, including soaps, lotions and cosmetics?
- What household cleaning products do you use?
- How much do your symptoms affect your quality of life, including your ability to sleep?
- What treatments have you tried so far? Has anything helped?
- How often do you shower or bathe?

DISEASE NAME: RINGWORM (BODY)


DISEASE NAME: RINGWORM (BODY)


DISEASE NAME: ATHLETE'S FOOT


## Overview
Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal skin infection that usually begins between the toes. It commonly occurs in people whose feet have become very sweaty while confined within tight-fitting shoes.
Signs and symptoms of athlete's foot include an itchy, scaly rash. The condition is contagious and can be spread via contaminated floors, towels or clothing.
Athlete's foot is closely related to other fungal infections such as ringworm and jock itch. It can be treated with antifungal medications, but the infection often comes back.

## Symptoms
Athlete's foot can affect one or both feet. Common signs and symptoms are:
- Scaly, peeling or cracked skin between the toes
- Itchiness, especially right after taking off shoes and socks
- Inflamed skin that might appear reddish, purplish or grayish, depending on your skin color
- Burning or stinging
- Blisters
- Dry, scaly skin on the bottom of the foot that extends up the side

## When to see a doctor
If you have a rash on your foot that doesn't improve within two weeks of beginning self-treatment with an over-the-counter antifungal product, see your doctor.
If you have diabetes, see your doctor if you suspect that you have athlete's foot. Also see your doctor if you have signs of an infection — swelling of the affected area, pus, fever.

## Causes
Athlete's foot is caused by the same type of fungi (dermatophytes) that cause ringworm and jock itch. Damp socks and shoes and warm, humid conditions favor the organisms' growth.
Athlete's foot is contagious and can spread through contact with an infected person or from contact with contaminated surfaces, such as towels, floors and shoes. You can also spread it from the foot to other parts of the body, especially if you scratch or pick the infected parts of your foot.

## Risk factors
You are at higher risk of athlete's foot if you:
- Frequently wear enclosed footwear
- Sweat heavily
- Share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection
- Walk barefoot in public areas where the infection can spread, such as locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools, communal baths and showers

## Complications
The athlete's foot infection can spread to other warm, moist parts of the body. Jock itch is often caused by the same fungus that results in athlete's foot. It's common for the infection to spread from the feet to the groin because the fungus can travel on hands or towels.
Athlete's foot can sometimes lead to bacterial infections.

## Prevention
These tips can help you avoid athlete's foot or avoid spreading it to others:
- Let your feet air out.When you can, wear sandals to let your feet air out as much as possible.
- Wash your feet daily.Use warm, soapy water and rinse and dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes. Apply a medicated foot powder (Tinactin, Gold Bond, others) or other medicated powder (Lotrimin AF, Zeasorb, others) if you're prone to athlete's foot.
- Change socks regularly.Change your socks at least once a day — more often if your feet get really sweaty. Moisture-wicking socks, such as those made from cotton, help keep your feet drier than do nylon socks.
- Alternate pairs of shoes.Use different shoes from day to day. This gives your shoes time to dry after each use.
- Protect your feet in public places.Wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers and lockers rooms.
- Be aware of the risk factors for spreading the condition.If you live with others, don't share shoes or unwashed bedding and towels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: ATHLETE'S FOOT


## Diagnosis
Your doctor may be able to diagnose athlete's foot simply by looking at it. Some types of athletes foot look like dry skin or dermatitis. To help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, your doctor might take a skin scraping from the affected area for testing in a lab.

## Treatment
If your athlete's foot doesn't respond to nonprescription products and self-care, you may need to see a doctor to get a prescription-strength cream or ointment, such as clotrimazole, econazole (Ecoza) or ciclopirox (Loprox). If you have a more serious infection, your doctor might prescribe antifungal pills, such as terbinafine or itraconazole (Sporanox, Tolsura). Or you might need both topical and oral medicine.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
These tips can help you ease the symptoms of athlete's foot or avoid a recurrence:
- Keep your feet clean and dry.Wash your feet twice a day and gently towel-dry between the toes.
- Use an antifungal product.After washing and drying your feet, apply an antifungal product. The antifungal terbinafine (Lamisil AT) has been shown to be very effective. Another option is clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF). You may need to experiment to find the product and formulation — ointment, gel, cream, lotion, powder or spray — that work for you. Apply the product to the affected skin as directed — usually twice a day until a week after the rash clears up. It might take 2 to 4 weeks to see results. If the condition comes back, you might need to start applying the product again.
- Change socks regularly.Change your socks at least once a day — more often if your feet get really sweaty.
- Wear light, well-ventilated footwear.Avoid shoes made of synthetic material, such as vinyl or rubber. Wear sandals when possible to let your feet air out.
- Alternate pairs of shoes.Use different shoes from day to day. This gives your shoes time to dry after each use.
- Protect your feet in public places.Wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers and lockers rooms.
- Try not to scratch the rash.You can try soothing your itchy feet by soaking them in cool water.
- Don't share shoes.Sharing risks spreading a fungal infection.

Your primary care doctor or a skin specialist (dermatologist) can diagnose athlete's foot. You don't need any special preparations for an appointment to diagnose athlete's foot.

## What you can do
Before your appointment, you might want to write down a list of questions to ask your doctor. Examples include:
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- Are tests needed to confirm the diagnosis?
- What treatments are available?
- Is this condition temporary or long lasting?
- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
- Can I wait to see if the condition goes away on its own?
- What can I do to prevent the infection from spreading?
- What skin care routines do you recommend while the condition heals?

## What to expect from your doctor
Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as:
- When did you first notice your symptoms?
- What did the rash look like when it first started?
- Is the rash painful or itchy?
- Does anything seem to make it better?
- What, if anything, makes it worse?
- Does a family member also have athlete's foot?
- Have you spent time at swimming pools, locker rooms, saunas or other places where athlete's foot might be spread?

DISEASE NAME: TYPE 2 DIABETES


## Overview
Type 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. It was once called adult-onset diabetes.
Over time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar.
Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes.
There's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help.

## Symptoms
Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often come on slowly. In fact, people can live with type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. When there are symptoms, they may include:
- More thirst.
- More urination.
- More hunger.
- Weight loss.
- Tiredness.
- Blurred vision.
- Slow-healing sores.
- Frequent infections.
- Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet.
- Areas of darkened skin, most often in the armpits and neck.

## When to see a doctor
See your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of type 2 diabetes.

## Causes
Type 2 diabetes is mainly the result of two issues:
- Cells in muscle, fat and the liver don't respond to insulin as they should. As a result, the cells don't take in enough sugar.
- The gland that makes insulin, called the pancreas, can't make enough to keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range.
Being overweight and not moving enough are key factors.

## How insulin works
Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland that sits behind and below the stomach. The gland is called the pancreas. Insulin manages how the body uses sugar in the following ways:
- Sugar in the bloodstream causes the pancreas to release insulin.
- Insulin in the bloodstream gets sugar into the cells.
- The amount of sugar in the bloodstream drops.
- Then the pancreas releases less insulin.

## The role of glucose
A sugar called glucose is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.
- Glucose comes from two major sources. They are food and the liver.
- Glucose goes into the bloodstream. There it enters cells with the help of insulin.
- The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen and also makes glucose.
- When glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps the body's glucose level within a healthy range.
In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. Over time, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin are damaged. Then the cells can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs.

## Risk factors
Factors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:
- Excess weight.Being overweight or obese is a main risk.
- Waist size.Storing fat mainly in the belly rather than in the hips and thighs raises the risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in people assigned male at birth whose waists measure more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters). For people assigned female at birth, a waist measure of more than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) raises the risk.
- Sitting.The less active a person is, the higher the risk. Physical activity helps manage weight, uses up glucose as energy and helps cells take in insulin.
- Family history.Having a parent or sibling who has type 2 diabetes raises the risk.
- Race and ethnicity.It's not clear why, but people of certain races and ethnicities are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than white people are. Races and ethnicities include Black people, Hispanic people, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Island people.
- Blood lipid levels.A higher risk is linked with low levels of high-density lipoprotein. Also called HDL cholesterol, this is the "good" cholesterol. Higher risk also is linked with high levels of a certain type of fat in the blood, called triglycerides.
- Age.The risk of type 2 diabetes goes up with age, mainly after age 35.
- Prediabetes.Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than the standard range, but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. If not treated, prediabetes often moves on to become type 2 diabetes.
- Pregnancy-related risks.The risk of getting type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant. And it's higher in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).
- Polycystic ovary syndrome.This condition results in irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity. It raises the risk of diabetes.

## Complications
Type 2 diabetes affects many major organs. These include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Also, factors that raise the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases. Managing diabetes and blood sugar can lower the risk for these complications and other medical conditions, including:
- Heart and blood vessel disease.Diabetes is linked with a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowed blood vessels, called atherosclerosis.
- Nerve damage in arms and legs.This condition is called neuropathy. High blood sugar over time can damage or destroy nerves. Neuropathy may cause tingling, numbness, burning, pain or loss of feeling. It most often begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and slowly spreads upward.
- Other nerve damage.Damage to nerves of the heart can cause irregular heart rhythms. Nerve damage in the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Nerve damage also may cause erectile dysfunction.
- Kidney disease.Diabetes may lead to long-term kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. End-stage kidney disease may need to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant.
- Eye damage.Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye conditions. Conditions include cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetes also may damage the blood vessels of the retina, which is the part of the eye that senses light. This is called diabetic retinopathy. This damage can lead to blindness.
- Skin conditions.Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems. Skin problems may include bacterial and fungal infections.
- Slow healing.Cuts and blisters that aren't treated can become serious infections. The infections may heal poorly. Bad damage can result in the need to use surgery to remove a toe, foot or leg. This surgery is called amputation.
- Hearing impairment.Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.
- Sleep apnea.Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people who have type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main cause of both conditions.
- Dementia.Type 2 diabetes seems to raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that cause dementia. Poorly managed blood sugar is linked to a faster loss of memory and other thinking skills.

## Prevention
Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes may slow the condition or keep it from becoming diabetes.
A healthy lifestyle includes the following:
- Eat healthy foods.Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
- Be active.Aim for 150 or more minutes a week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling, running or swimming.
- Lose weight.If you are overweight, losing some weight and keeping it off may slow prediabetes from becoming type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight may lower the risk of diabetes.
- Don't sit for long.Sitting for long periods can raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. Get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.
People with prediabetes may take metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others), a diabetes medicine, to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is most often prescribed for older adults who are obese and who can't lower blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes.

DISEASE NAME: TYPE 2 DIABETES


## Diagnosis
The glycated hemoglobin test most often diagnoses type 2 diabetes. Also called the A1C test, it reflects the average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. Results mean the following:
- Below 5.7% is healthy.
- 5.7% to 6.4% is prediabetes.
- 6.5% or higher on two separate tests means diabetes.
If there are no A1C tests or if you have certain conditions that get in the way of A1C test results, your healthcare professional may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes:
Random blood sugar test.Blood sugar values show in milligrams of sugar per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles of sugar per liter (mmol/L) of blood. It doesn't matter when you last ate. A level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes. This is most likely if you also have symptoms of diabetes, such as urinating often and being very thirsty.
Fasting blood sugar test.You give a blood sample for testing after not eating overnight. Results are as follows:
- Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is healthy.
- 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is prediabetes.
- 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two tests is diabetes.
Oral glucose tolerance test.This mainly tests the blood sugar of people who are pregnant and those who have cystic fibrosis. You don't eat for a certain amount of time. Then you drink a sugary liquid at your healthcare team's office. You give blood samples over two hours to test blood sugar levels. Results are as follows:
- Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after two hours is healthy.
- 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) is prediabetes.
- 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher after two hours suggests diabetes.
Screening.The American Diabetes Association suggests that all adults age 35 or older have routine tests for type 2 diabetes. Others to be tested include:
- People younger than 35 who are overweight or obese and have one or more risk factors linked to diabetes.
- Women who had diabetes while pregnant, called gestational diabetes.
- People who have been diagnosed with prediabetes.
- Children who are overweight or obese and who have a family history of type 2 diabetes or other risk factors.

## After a diagnosis
If you're diagnosed with diabetes, your healthcare professional may do other tests to see whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Treatment depends on which condition you have.
Your healthcare team tests A1C levels at least two times a year and when your treatment changes. Target A1C goals depend on age and other factors. For most people, the American Diabetes Association suggests an A1C level below 7%.
You also have other tests to screen for complications of diabetes and other medical conditions.

## Treatment
Living with type 2 diabetes involves learning about the condition and lifestyle changes. Diabetes education is an important part of managing the condition. Management includes:
- Healthy eating.
- Regular exercise.
- Weight loss if needed.
- Diabetes medicine or insulin therapy if needed.
- Keeping track of blood sugar.
These steps make it more likely that blood sugar will stay in a healthy range. And they may help delay or prevent complications.

## Healthy eating
There's no diabetes diet. But it's good to focus your eating on:
- A regular schedule for meals and healthy snacks.
- Smaller amounts of food.
- More high-fiber foods, such as fruits, nonstarchy vegetables and whole grains.
- Fewer refined grains, starchy vegetables and sweets.
- Modest servings of low-fat dairy, low-fat meats and fish.
- Healthy cooking oils, such as olive oil or canola oil.
- Fewer calories.
You may see a registered dietitian, who can help you:
- Make healthy food choices.
- Plan healthy meals.
- Make new habits and learn what stops you from changing habits.
- Watch carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.

## Physical activity
Exercise is important to lose weight or stay at a healthy weight. It also helps manage blood sugar. Talk with your healthcare team before starting or changing your exercise program to make sure the activities are safe for you.
- Aerobic activity.Choose activities that you enjoy. Try walking, swimming, biking or running. Aim to get about 30 minutes or more of moderate aerobic exercise on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes a week.
- Strength training.Strength training increases your strength, balance and ability to do activities of daily living. Strength training can be done using free weights, resistance tubes, weight machines or your  body weight for resistance. Aim to do strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week.
- Move more.Breaking up long periods of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.

## Weight loss
Losing weight can help you manage blood sugar levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. If you're overweight, you may see these factors improve after you lose as little as 5% of your body weight. The more weight you lose, the better it is for your health.
Your healthcare professional or dietitian can help you set good weight-loss goals and make lifestyle changes to help you reach them.

## Tracking your blood sugar
Your healthcare team will tell you how often to check your blood sugar level. This is to make sure that your blood sugar stays in the target range. You may, for instance, need to check it once a day and before or after exercise. If you take insulin, you may need to check your blood sugar several times a day.
You can use a small, at-home device called a blood glucose meter. This measures the amount of sugar in a drop of blood. Keep a record to share with your healthcare team.
Continuous glucose monitoring is an electronic system that records blood sugar levels every few minutes from a sensor put under the skin. The sensor most often is in the arm. The system can send results to a mobile device such as a phone. And the system can alert you when levels are too high or too low.

## Diabetes medicines
If you can't stay at your target blood sugar level with diet and exercise, your healthcare team may prescribe diabetes medicines that help lower glucose levels. Or you may start insulin therapy. Medicines for type 2 diabetes include the following.
Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others)is most often the first medicine prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works mainly in two ways. It lowers the amount of glucose the liver makes. And it helps the body use insulin better.
Some people who take metformin, may get B-12 deficiency and may need to take supplements. There are other side effects that may get better over time. Side effects might include:
- Nausea.
- Belly pain.
- Bloating.
- Diarrhea.
Sulfonylureashelp the body make more insulin. These include glipizide (Glucotrol XL) and glimepiride (Amaryl). Side effects might include:
- Low blood sugar.
- Weight gain.
Another sulfonylurea is glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase). It has a higher risk of low blood sugar.
Glinideshelp the pancreas to make more insulin. They work faster than sulfonylureas. But their effect doesn't last as long. They include repaglinide and nateglinide. Side effects might include:
- Low blood sugar.
- Weight gain.
Thiazolidinedioneshelp the body's tissues take in more insulin. These include pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone. Side effects might include:
- Weight gain.
- Broken bones.
- Fluid retention.
- Heart failure.
DPP-4 inhibitorshelp lower blood sugar levels. But they tend to have only a small effect. Medicines include alogliptin (Nesina), sitagliptin (Januvia), saxagliptin and linagliptin (Tradjenta). Side effects might include:
- Pancreatitis.
- Joint pain.
GLP-1 receptor agonistsare medicines taken by shot, called injection. They slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels. Their use is often linked with weight loss. Some lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.
These medicines include dulaglutide (Trulicity) exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon Bcise), liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza) and semaglutide (Rybelsus, Ozempic, Wegovy). Side effects might include:
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Diarrhea.
SGLT2 inhibitorsaffect the how the kidneys filter blood. They block the return of glucose to the bloodstream. Excess glucose then leaves the body in the urine. These medicines may lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with a high risk of those conditions.
These medicines include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance). Side effects might include:
- Vaginal yeast infections.
- Urinary tract infections.
- Low blood pressure.
- High cholesterol.
- Gangrene.
- Broken bones.
- Risk of amputation.
Other medicinesyour healthcare professional might prescribe are medicines to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Low-dose aspirin may help prevent heart and blood vessel conditions.

## Insulin therapy
Some people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy. In the past, people tried insulin therapy only after other treatments had failed. But today, it may be prescribed sooner if lifestyle changes and other medicines don't manage blood sugar levels.
Insulin types vary by how quickly they work and how long they last. Long-acting insulin, for instance, works overnight or throughout the day to keep blood sugar levels even. People most often take short-acting insulin at mealtimes.
Your healthcare professional prescribes the type of insulin that's right for you and advises you when to take it. Your insulin type, dosage and schedule may change. That depends on how stable your blood sugar levels are. People take most types of insulin as an injection.
A side effect of insulin is low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia.

## Weight-loss surgery
Weight-loss surgery changes the shape of the digestive system and how it works. This surgery may help you lose weight and manage type 2 diabetes and other conditions linked to obesity.
There are a few surgical procedures. All of them help people lose weight by limiting how much food they can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of nutrients the body can absorb.
Weight-loss surgery is only one part of an overall treatment plan. Treatment also includes diet and nutritional supplements, exercise and mental health care.
Weight-loss surgery may be a choice for adults living with type 2 diabetes who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher. BMI is a formula that uses weight and height to estimate body fat. Surgery also may be a choice for someone with a BMI lower than 35. This depends on how bad the diabetes is or whether there are other medical conditions.
If you have weight-loss surgery, you need to make lifestyle changes for life. Long-term side effects may include not taking in enough nutrients and the bone-loss condition, osteoporosis.

## Pregnancy
People who have type 2 diabetes often need to change their treatment plan during pregnancy and follow a diet that controls carbohydrates. Many people need insulin therapy during pregnancy. They also may need to stop other treatments, such as certain blood pressure medicines.
You have a higher risk during pregnancy of getting a condition that affects the eyes, called diabetic retinopathy. This condition may get worse during pregnancy.
If you're pregnant, visit a specialist in eye care, called an ophthalmologist. Go each trimester of your pregnancy and one year after you give birth. Or go as often as your healthcare team advises.

## Signs of trouble
You need to track your blood sugar levels to keep from getting serious complications. Also, know of symptoms that may mean that blood sugar levels need care right away. They include:
High blood sugar.This condition also is called hyperglycemia. Eating certain foods or too much food, being sick, or not taking diabetes medicines at the right time can cause high blood sugar. Symptoms include:
- Urinating often.
- Extreme thirst.
- Dry mouth.
- Blurred vision.
- Tiredness.
- Headache.
Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.Also called HHNS, this life-threatening condition includes a blood sugar reading higher than 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L). HHNS may be more likely if you have an infection, don't take medicines as prescribed, or take certain steroids or other medicines that cause you to urinate often. Symptoms include:
- Dry mouth.
- Extreme thirst.
- Drowsiness.
- Confusion.
- Dark urine.
- Seizures.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.Diabetic ketoacidosis happens when a lack of insulin results in the body breaking down fat for fuel rather than sugar. This causes a buildup of acids called ketones in the bloodstream.
Triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis include certain illnesses, pregnancy and medicines. The diabetes medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially when used in people living with type 1 diabetes.
Diabetic ketoacidosis makes acids that are toxic. So the condition can be life-threatening. Besides the symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as urinating often and more thirst, ketoacidosis may cause:
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Belly pain.
- Shortness of breath.
- Fruity-smelling breath.
Low blood sugar.Low blood sugar is when blood sugar levels drop below the target range. This condition also is called hypoglycemia. Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons. These include missing a meal, taking more medicine than usual or being more physically active than usual. Symptoms include:
- Sweating.
- Shakiness.
- Weakness.
- Hunger.
- Irritability.
- Dizziness.
- Headache.
- Blurred vision.
- Heart palpitations.
- Slurred speech.
- Drowsiness.
- Confusion.
If you have symptoms of low blood sugar, drink or eat something that raises your blood sugar level quickly. Try fruit juice, sugared soda, glucose tablets, hard candy or another source of sugar. Retest your blood in 15 minutes.
If levels are not at your target, eat or drink another source of sugar. Eat a meal after your blood sugar level returns to normal.
If you pass out, someone needs to give you a shot of glucagon. This hormone causes the release of sugar into the blood.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Careful management of type 2 diabetes can lower the risk of serious, or even life-threatening complications. Try these tips:
- Commit to managing your diabetes.Learn all you can about type 2 diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine.
- Work with your team.Connect with a certified diabetes education specialist. Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.
- Let others know.Wear a necklace or bracelet that says you have diabetes. This is most important if you take insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medicine.
- Schedule a yearly physical exam and regular eye exams.Your diabetes checkups aren't meant to replace regular physicals or routine eye exams.
- Keep your vaccinations up to date.High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year. Stay current on COVID-19 vaccines. Your healthcare team also may suggest the pneumonia vaccine.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also suggests the hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't had this vaccine and you're 19 to 59 years old. Talk to your healthcare team about other vaccinations you may need.

- Take care of your teeth.Diabetes may make you more likely to get serious gum infections. Brush and floss your teeth regularly and schedule regular dental exams. Contact your dentist right away if your gums bleed or look red or swollen.
- Watch your feet.Wash your feet daily in lukewarm water. Dry them gently, including between the toes. Use lotion to moisturize them.Check your feet every day for blisters, cuts, sores, changes in color and swelling. Contact your healthcare team if you have a sore or other foot problem that isn't healing.

- Manage your blood pressure and cholesterol.Eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can go a long way toward managing high blood pressure and cholesterol. Take medicines as prescribed.
- Don't use tobacco products.If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your healthcare team to help you quit. Smoking raises the risk of diabetes complications.
- Use alcohol sparingly.Drinks with alcohol may lower or raise blood sugar levels. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so only with a meal.Drink in moderation. That means no more than one drink daily for people assigned female at birth and no more than two drinks daily for people assigned male at birth. Check your blood sugar often after drinking alcohol.

- Get good sleep.Many people with type 2 diabetes have sleep problems. Not getting enough sleep may make it harder to keep blood sugar levels in a healthy range. If you have trouble sleeping, talk with your healthcare team about ways to sleep better.

## Alternative medicine
Many alternative medicine treatments claim to help people living with diabetes. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health says studies haven't shown enough proof for any alternative therapies to manage blood sugar. Research has shown the following results about popular supplements for type 2 diabetes:
- Chromiumsupplements have been shown to help little to none. Large doses can cause kidney damage, muscle problems and skin reactions.
- Magnesiumsupplements have been shown to help with blood sugar management in some but not all studies. Side effects include diarrhea and cramping. Doses of more than 5,000 mg a day can be fatal.
- Cinnamon,in some studies, has lowered fasting glucose levels but not A1C levels. So there's no proof that cinnamon improves blood sugar management overall.
Talk with your healthcare team before using a dietary supplement or natural treatment. Don't use alternative medicines in place of your prescribed diabetes medicines.

## Coping and support
Type 2 diabetes is a serious disease. Following a diabetes treatment plan can be hard. To manage diabetes well, you may need a good support network.
Anxiety and depression are common in people living with diabetes. Talking to a counselor or therapist may help you cope with the lifestyle changes you need to make and the stress that comes with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis.
Support groups can be good sources of diabetes education, emotional support and helpful information. You might learn how to find local resources or where to find carbohydrate counts for a favorite restaurant. If you want to join a support group, your healthcare team may be able to suggest a group in your area.
Visit the American Diabetes Association website to find local activities and support groups for people with type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association also offers online information and online forums where you can chat with others who are living with diabetes. You also can call the organization at 800-DIABETES (800-342-2383).

## Preparing for your appointment
Your annual wellness visit can include screening for diabetes. And it can include watching for and treating conditions that raise your risk of diabetes. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol or a high BMI.
If you have symptoms that may be linked to diabetes, be ready to answer the following questions at your visit:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Does anything make the symptoms better or worse?
- What medicines do you take, including dietary supplements and herbal remedies?
- What do you eat in a typical day? Do you eat between meals or before bedtime?
- How much alcohol do you drink?
- How much daily exercise do you get?
- Is there a history of diabetes in your family?
If you are diagnosed with diabetes, your healthcare professional may begin a treatment plan. Or you may be sent to a specialist in hormonal disorders, called an endocrinologist. Your care team also may include the following specialists:
- Dietitian.
- Certified diabetes education specialist.
- Foot doctor, also called a podiatrist.
- Specialist in eye care, called an ophthalmologist.
Talk with your healthcare professional about other specialists you might need.

## Questions for ongoing appointments
Anytime you see a member of your treatment team, ask if there's anything you need to do before the appointment. These may include not eating or drinking before a test. Always talk about the following with your healthcare team:
- How often do I need to check my blood sugar? What is my target range?
- What changes in my diet would help me better manage my blood sugar?
- What is the right dosage for medicines you prescribe?
- When do I take the medicines? Do I take them with food?
- How does managing my diabetes affect treatments for other conditions? How can I make sure treatments work together?
- When do I need to make a follow-up appointment?
- When should I call you or seek emergency care?
- Are there brochures or online sources you suggest?
- Is there help if I'm having trouble paying for diabetes supplies?

## What to expect from your doctor
Your healthcare team might ask you questions at your appointments, such as:
- Do you know your treatment plan and feel that you can follow it?
- How are you coping with diabetes?
- Have you had any low blood sugar?
- What do you do if your blood sugar is too low or too high?
- What do you most often eat in a day?
- Do you exercise? What type of exercise? How often?
- Do you sit for long periods of time?
- What makes managing your diabetes hard for you?

DISEASE NAME: OBESITY


## Overview
Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of many other diseases and health problems. These can include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.
There are many reasons why some people have trouble losing weight. Often, obesity results from inherited, physiological and environmental factors, combined with diet, physical activity and exercise choices.
The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. A healthier diet, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medicines and weight-loss procedures are other options for treating obesity.

## Symptoms
Body mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculateBMI, multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculateBMI.
SeeBMIcalculator
Asians with aBMIof 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems.
For most people,BMIprovides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However,BMIdoesn't directly measure body fat. Some people, such as muscular athletes, may have aBMIin the obesity category even though they don't have excess body fat.
Many health care professionals also measure around a person's waist to help guide treatment decisions. This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight loss program to track progress.

## When to see a doctor
If you're concerned about your weight or weight-related health problems, ask your health care professional about obesity management. You and your health care team can evaluate your health risks and discuss your weight-loss options.

## Causes
Although there are genetic, behavioral, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through typical daily activities and exercise. Your body stores these excess calories as fat.
In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry sooner, or eat more due to stress or anxiety.
Many people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories, courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping, and drive-through restaurants and banks.

## Risk factors
Obesity often results from a combination of causes and contributing factors:

## Family inheritance and influences
The genes you inherit from your parents may affect the amount of body fat you store, and where that fat is distributed. Genetics also may play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy, how your body regulates your appetite and how your body burns calories during exercise.
Obesity tends to run in families. That's not just because of the genes they share. Family members also tend to share similar eating and activity habits.

## Lifestyle choices
- Unhealthy diet.A diet that's high in calories, lacking in fruits and vegetables, full of fast food, and laden with high-calorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain.
- Liquid calories.People can drink many calories without feeling full, especially calories from alcohol. Other high-calorie beverages, such as sugared soft drinks, can contribute to weight gain.
- Inactivity.If you have an inactive lifestyle, you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily activities. Looking at computer, tablet and phone screens is inactivity. The number of hours spent in front of a screen is highly associated with weight gain.

## Certain diseases and medications
In some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and other conditions. Medical problems, such as arthritis, also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain.
Some medicines can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate through diet or activity. These medicines include steroids, some antidepressants, anti-seizure medicines, diabetes medicines, antipsychotic medicines and certain beta blockers.

## Social and economic issues
Social and economic factors are linked to obesity. It's hard to avoid obesity if you don't have safe areas to walk or exercise. You may not have learned healthy ways of cooking. Or you may not have access to healthier foods. Also, the people you spend time with may influence your weight. You're more likely to develop obesity if you have friends or relatives with obesity.

## Age
Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. The amount of muscle in your body also tends to decrease with age. Lower muscle mass often leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you'll likely gain weight.

## Other factors
- Pregnancy.Weight gain is common during pregnancy. Some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.
- Quitting smoking.Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. And for some, it can lead to enough weight gain to qualify as obesity. Often, this happens as people use food to cope with smoking withdrawal. But overall, quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than is continuing to smoke. Your health care team can help you prevent weight gain after quitting smoking.
- Lack of sleep.Not getting enough sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase appetite. So can getting too much sleep. You also may crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.
- Stress.Many external factors that affect mood and well-being may contribute to obesity. People often seek more high-calorie food during stressful situations.
- Microbiome.The make-up of your gut bacteria is affected by what you eat and may contribute to weight gain or trouble losing weight.
Even if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you're destined to develop obesity. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise. Behavior changes, medicines and procedures for obesity also can help.

## Complications
People with obesity are more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including:
- Heart disease and strokes.Obesity makes you more likely to have high blood pressure and unhealthy cholesterol levels, which are risk factors for heart disease and strokes.
- Type 2 diabetes.Obesity can affect the way the body uses insulin to control blood sugar levels. This raises the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.
- Certain cancers.Obesity may increase the risk of cancer of the uterus, cervix, endometrium, ovary, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney and prostate.
- Digestive problems.Obesity increases the likelihood of developing heartburn, gallbladder disease and liver problems.
- Sleep apnea.People with obesity are more likely to have sleep apnea, a potentially serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.
- Osteoarthritis.Obesity increases the stress placed on weight-bearing joints. It also promotes inflammation, which includes swelling, pain and a feeling of heat within the body. These factors may lead to complications such as osteoarthritis.
- Fatty liver disease.Obesity increases the risk of fatty liver disease, a condition that happens due to excessive fat deposit in the liver. In some cases, this can lead to serious liver damage, known as liver cirrhosis.
- Severe COVID-19 symptoms.Obesity increases the risk of developing severe symptoms if you become infected with the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19. People who have severe cases ofCOVID-19may need treatment in intensive care units or even mechanical assistance to breathe.

## Quality of life
Obesity can diminish the overall quality of life. You may not be able to do physical activities that you used to enjoy. You may avoid public places. People with obesity may even encounter discrimination.
Other weight-related issues that may affect your quality of life include:
- Depression.
- Disability.
- Shame and guilt.
- Social isolation.
- Lower work achievement.

DISEASE NAME: OBESITY


## Diagnosis
To diagnose obesity, your health care professional may perform a physical exam and recommend some tests.
These exams and tests often include:
- Taking your health history.Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions.
- A general physical exam.This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen.
- Calculating yourBMI.Your health care professional checks your body mass index, calledBMI. ABMIof 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have yourBMIchecked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you.
- Measuring your waist size.The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like theBMImeasurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year.
- Checking for other health problems.If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes.
Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you.

## Treatment
The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity.
You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits.
The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits.
All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan.

## Dietary changes
Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are key to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight. It's also the best way to keep weight off permanently.
There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include:
- Cutting calories.The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. The first step is to review your typical eating and drinking habits. You can see how many calories you usually consume and where you can cut back. You and your health care professional can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight. A typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men.
- Feeling full on less.Some foods — such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods — contain a lot of calories for a small portion. In contrast, fruits and vegetables provide a larger portion size with fewer calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you can reduce hunger pangs and take in fewer calories. You also may feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall.
- Making healthier choices.To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods. These include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Also emphasize lean sources of protein — such as beans, lentils and soy — and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils.
- Restricting certain foods.Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your health care professional which diet plans are effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended. Limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories.
- Meal replacements.These plans suggest replacing one or two meals each day with their products — such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars — and eating healthy snacks. Then you have a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. But these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle. So you may have to stay on the diet if you want to keep your weight off.
Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. But the reality is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets.
Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight — and keep it off — you must adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time.

## Exercise and activity
Getting more physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment:
- Exercise.People with obesity need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This can help prevent further weight gain or maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. You'll probably need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve.
- Keep moving.Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. For example, park farther from store entrances and take the stairs instead of the elevator. A pedometer can track how many steps you take over the course of a day. Many people try to reach 10,000 steps every day. Gradually increase the number of steps you take daily to reach your goal.

## Behavior changes
A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes to lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include looking at your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity.
- Counseling.Talking with a mental health professional can help address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You also can learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Counseling can be one-on-one or in a group.
- Support groups.You can find friendship and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your health care team, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area.

## Weight-loss medicines
Weight-loss medicines are meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. Before selecting a medication for you, your health care professional will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects.
The most commonly used medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity include:
- Bupropion-naltrexone (Contrave).
- Liraglutide (Saxenda).
- Orlistat (Alli, Xenical).
- Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia).
- Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy).
Weight-loss medicines may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medicine, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost.

## Endoscopic procedures for weight loss
These types of procedures don't require any cuts, also called incisions, in the skin. After you are under anesthesia, flexible tubes and tools are inserted through the mouth and down the throat into the stomach. Common procedures include:
- Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty.This procedure involves placing stitches in the stomach to reduce the amount of food and liquid the stomach can hold at one time. Over time, eating and drinking less helps the average person lose weight.
- Intragastric balloon for weight loss.In this procedure, you have a small balloon placed into the stomach. The balloon is then filled with water to reduce the amount of space in the stomach, so you'll feel full eating less food. Intragastric balloons are left in place for up to 6 months and are then removed using an endoscope. At that time, a new balloon may be placed, or not, depending on the plan determined by you and your health care team.

## Weight-loss surgery
Also known as bariatric surgery, weight-loss surgery limits how much food you can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of calories and nutrients you can absorb. But this also can result in nutritional and vitamin deficiencies.
Common weight-loss surgeries include:
- Adjustable gastric banding.In this surgery, an inflatable band placed around the outside of the stomach divides it into two pouches. The surgeon pulls the band tight, like a belt, to create a narrow pathway between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from getting bigger. The band often stays in place permanently.
- Gastric bypass surgery.In gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y (roo-en-wy) gastric bypass, the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach.
- Gastric sleeve.In this surgery, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass.
Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits.

## Other treatments
Other treatments for obesity include:
- Hydrogels.Available by prescription, these edible capsules contain tiny particles that absorb water and get bigger in the stomach, to help you feel full. The capsules are taken before meals and are passed through the intestines as stool.
- Vagal nerve blockade.This involves implanting a device under the skin in the stomach area. The device sends electrical pulses to a nerve in that area, called the abdominal vagus nerve. This nerve tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full.
- Gastric aspirate.In this procedure, a tube is placed through the abdomen into the stomach. A portion of the stomach contents are drained out after each meal.

## Clinical trials
Explore Mayo Clinic studiestesting new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Your effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home along with your formal treatment plan. These can include:
- Learning about your condition.Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you developed obesity and what you can do about it. You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan. Read reputable self-help books and consider talking about them with your health care professional or therapist.
- Setting realistic goals.When you have to lose a lot of weight, you may set goals that are unrealistic, such as trying to lose too much too fast. Don't set yourself up for failure. Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss. Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you're not likely to stick with for the long haul.
- Sticking to your treatment plan.Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be hard to do. Be honest with your doctor, therapist or other health care professionals if you find your activity or eating goals slipping. You can work together to come up with new ideas or new approaches.
- Enlisting support.Get your family and friends on board with your weight-loss goals. Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you, not sabotage your efforts. Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health. You also might want to join a weight-loss support group.
- Keeping a record.Keep a food and activity log. This record can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits. You can discover things that may be holding you back. You also might see what works well for you. You can use your log to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels and overall fitness.

## Alternative medicine
Many dietary supplements that promise to help you shed weight quickly are available. The long-term effectiveness and safety of these products are often questionable.

## Coping and support
Talk to your health care professional or therapist about improving your coping skills. Consider these tips to cope with obesity and your weight-loss efforts:
- Journal.Write in a journal to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions.
- Connect.Don't become isolated. Try to participate in regular activities and get together with family or friends periodically.
- Join.Join a support group so that you can connect with others facing similar challenges.
- Focus.Stay focused on your goals. Overcoming obesity is an ongoing process. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. Remind yourself that you're responsible for managing your condition and working toward your goals.
- Relax.Learn relaxation and stress management. Learning to recognize stress and developing stress management and relaxation skills can help you gain control of unhealthy eating habits.

## Preparing for your appointment
Talking to your health care professional openly and honestly about your weight concerns is one of the best things you can do for your health. In some cases, you may be referred to an obesity specialist — if one is available in your area. You also may be referred to a behavioral counselor or dietitian.

## What you can do
Being an active participant in your care is important. One way to do this is by preparing for your appointment. Think about your needs and goals for treatment. Also, write down a list of questions to ask. These questions may include:
- What eating or activity habits are likely contributing to my health concerns and weight gain?
- What can I do about the challenges I face in managing my weight?
- Do I have other health problems that are caused by obesity?
- Should I see a dietitian?
- Should I see a behavioral counselor with expertise in weight management?
- What are the treatment options for obesity and my other health problems?
- Is weight-loss surgery or another intervention an option for me?
Be sure to let your health care team know about any medical conditions you have and about any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you take.

## What to expect from your doctor
During your appointment, your health care professional is likely to ask you a number of questions about your weight, eating, activity, mood and thoughts, and any symptoms you might have. You may be asked questions such as:
- How much did you weigh in high school?
- What life events may have been associated with weight gain?
- What, when and how much do you eat in a typical day?
- How much activity do you get in a typical day?
- During what periods of your life did you gain weight?
- What are the factors that you believe affect your weight?
- How is your daily life affected by your weight?
- What diets or treatments have you tried to lose weight?
- What are your weight-loss goals?
- Are you ready to make changes in your lifestyle to lose weight?
- What do you think might prevent you from losing weight?

## What you can do in the meantime
If you have time before your scheduled appointment, you can get ready for the appointment by keeping a diet diary for two weeks before the appointment. You also can record how many steps you take in a day by using a step counter, called a pedometer.
And you can begin to make choices that will help you start to lose weight, including:
- Making healthy changes in your diet.Include more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet. Begin to reduce portion sizes.
- Increasing your activity level.Try to get up and move around your home more often. Start gradually if you aren't in good shape or aren't used to exercising. Even a 10-minute daily walk can help. If you have any health conditions or are over a certain age — over 40 for men and over 50 for women — wait until you've talked to your health care professional before you start a new exercise program.

DISEASE NAME: URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)


## Overview
A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.
Women are at greater risk of developing aUTIthan are men. If an infection is limited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if aUTIspreads to the kidneys.
Health care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. You can also take steps to lower the chance of getting aUTIin the first place.

## Symptoms
UTIs don't always cause symptoms. When they do, they may include:
- A strong urge to urinate that doesn't go away
- A burning feeling when urinating
- Urinating often, and passing small amounts of urine
- Urine that looks cloudy
- Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored — signs of blood in the urine
- Strong-smelling urine
- Pelvic pain, in women — especially in the center of the pelvis and around the area of the pubic bone
In older adults,UTIs may be overlooked or mistaken for other conditions.

## Types of urinary tract infections
Each type ofUTImay result in more-specific symptoms. The symptoms depend on which part of the urinary tract is affected.
- Back or side pain
- High fever
- Shaking and chills
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Pelvic pressure
- Lower belly discomfort
- Frequent, painful urination
- Blood in urine
- Burning with urination
- Discharge

## When to see a doctor
Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of aUTI.

## Causes
UTIs typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to spread in the bladder. The urinary system is designed to keep out bacteria. But the defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract.
The most commonUTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.
- Infection of the bladder.This type ofUTIis usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli).E. coliis a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.Having sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.
Infection of the bladder.This type ofUTIis usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli).E. coliis a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. But sometimes other bacteria are the cause.
Having sex also may lead to a bladder infection, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop one. All women are at risk of bladder infections because of their anatomy. In women, the urethra is close to the anus. And the urethral opening is close to the bladder. This makes it easier for bacteria around the anus to enter the urethra and to travel to the bladder.
- Infection of the urethra.This type ofUTIcan happen whenGIbacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. An infection of the urethra can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections. They include herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma. This can happen because women's urethras are close to the vagina.

## Risk factors
UTIs are common in women. Many women experience more than oneUTIduring their lifetimes.
Risk factors forUTIs that are specific to women include:
- Female anatomy.Women have a shorter urethra than men do. As a result, there's less distance for bacteria to travel to reach the bladder.
- Sexual activity.Being sexually active tends to lead to moreUTIs. Having a new sexual partner also increases risk.
- Certain types of birth control.Using diaphragms for birth control may increase the risk ofUTIs. Using spermicidal agents also can increase risk.
- Menopause.After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract. The changes can increase the risk ofUTIs.
Other risk factors forUTIs include:
- Urinary tract problems.Babies born with problems with their urinary tracts may have trouble urinating. Urine can back up in the urethra, which can causeUTIs.
- Blockages in the urinary tract.Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder. As a result, risk ofUTIs is higher.
- A suppressed immune system.Diabetes and other diseases can impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs. This can increase the risk ofUTIs.
- Catheter use.People who can't urinate on their own often must use a tube, called a catheter, to urinate. Using a catheter increases the risk ofUTIs. Catheters may be used by people who are in the hospital. They may also be used by people who have neurological problems that make it difficult to control urination or who are paralyzed.
- A recent urinary procedure.Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase the risk of developing aUTI.

## Complications
When treated promptly and properly, lower urinary tract infections rarely lead to complications. But left untreated,UTIs can cause serious health problems.
Complications of aUTImay include:
- Repeated infections, which means you have two or moreUTIs within six months or three or more within a year. Women are especially prone to having repeated infections.
- Permanent kidney damage from a kidney infection due to an untreatedUTI.
- Delivering a low birth weight or premature infant when aUTIoccurs during pregnancy.
- A narrowed urethra in men from having repeated infections of the urethra.
- Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. This is a risk especially if the infection travels up the urinary tract to the kidneys.

## Prevention
These steps may help lower the risk ofUTIs:
- Drink plenty of liquids, especially water.Drinking water helps dilute the urine. That leads to urinating more often — allowing bacteria to be flushed from the urinary tract before an infection can begin.
- Try cranberry juice.Studies that look into whether cranberry juice preventsUTIs aren't final. However, drinking cranberry juice is likely not harmful.
- Wipe from front to back.Do this after urinating and after a bowel movement. It helps prevent the spread of bacteria from the anus to the vagina and urethra.
- Empty your bladder soon after having sex.Also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.
- Avoid potentially irritating feminine products.Using them in the genital area can irritate the urethra. These products include deodorant sprays, douches and powders.
- Change your birth control method.Diaphragms, unlubricated condoms or condoms treated with spermicide can contribute to bacterial growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


DISEASE NAME: URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)


## Diagnosis
Tests and procedures used to diagnose urinary tract infections include:
- Analyzing a urine sample.Your health care provider may ask for a urine sample. The urine will be looked at in a lab to check for white blood cells, red blood cells or bacteria. You may be told to first wipe your genital area with an antiseptic pad and to collect the urine midstream. The process helps prevent the sample from being contaminated.
- Growing urinary tract bacteria in a lab.Lab analysis of the urine is sometimes followed by a urine culture. This test tells your provider what bacteria are causing the infection. It can let your provider know which medications will be most effective.
- Creating images of the urinary tract.RecurrentUTIs may be caused by a structural problem in the urinary tract. Your health care provider may order an ultrasound, aCTscan orMRIto look for this issue. A contrast dye may be used to highlight structures in your urinary tract.
- Using a scope to see inside the bladder.If you have recurrentUTIs, your health care provider may perform a cystoscopy. The test involves using a long, thin tube with a lens, called a cystoscope, to see inside the urethra and bladder. The cystoscope is inserted in the urethra and passed through to the bladder.

## Treatment
Antibiotics usually are the first treatment for urinary tract infections. Your health and the type of bacteria found in your urine determine which medicine is used and how long you need to take it.

## Simple infection
Medicines commonly used for simpleUTIs include:
- Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Bactrim DS)
- Fosfomycin (Monurol)
- Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin, Macrobid, Furadantin)
- Cephalexin
- Ceftriaxone
The group of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones isn't commonly recommended for simpleUTIs. These drugs include ciprofloxacin (Cipro), levofloxacin and others. The risks of these drugs generally outweigh the benefits for treating uncomplicatedUTIs.
In cases of a complicatedUTIor kidney infection, your health care provider might prescribe a fluoroquinolone medicine if there are no other treatment options.
Often,UTIsymptoms clear up within a few days of starting treatment. But you may need to continue antibiotics for a week or more. Take all of the medicine as prescribed.
For an uncomplicatedUTIthat occurs when you're otherwise healthy, your health care provider may recommend a shorter course of treatment. That may mean taking an antibiotic for 1 to 3 days. Whether a short course of treatment is enough to treat your infection depends on your symptoms and medical history.
Your health care provider also may give you a pain reliever to take that can ease burning while urinating. But pain usually goes away soon after starting an antibiotic.

## Frequent infections
If you have frequentUTIs, your health care provider may recommend:
- Low-dose antibiotics. You might take them for six months or longer.
- Diagnosing and treating yourself when symptoms occur. You'll also be asked to stay in touch with your provider.
- Taking a single dose of antibiotic after sex ifUTIs are related to sexual activity.
- Vaginal estrogen therapy if you've reached menopause.

## Severe infection
For a severeUTI, you may needIVantibiotics in a hospital.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Urinary tract infections can be painful, but you can take steps to ease discomfort until antibiotics treat the infection. Follow these tips:
- Drink plenty of water.Water helps to dilute your urine and flush out bacteria.
- Avoid drinks that may irritate your bladder.Avoid coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks containing citrus juices or caffeine until the infection has cleared. They can irritate your bladder and tend to increase the need to urinate.
- Use a heating pad.Apply a warm, but not hot, heating pad to your belly to help with bladder pressure or discomfort.

## Alternative medicine
Many people drink cranberry juice to preventUTIs. There's some indication that cranberry products, in either juice or tablet form, may have properties that fight an infection. Researchers continue to study the ability of cranberry juice to preventUTIs, but results aren't final.
There's little harm in drinking cranberry juice if you feel it helps you preventUTIs, but watch the calories. For most people, drinking cranberry juice is safe. However, some people report an upset stomach or diarrhea.
But don't drink cranberry juice if you're taking blood-thinning medication, such as warfarin (Jantovin).

## Preparing for your appointment
Your primary care provider, nurse practitioner or other health care provider can treat mostUTIs. If you have frequentUTIs or a chronic kidney infection, you may be referred to a health care provider who specializes in urinary disorders. This type of doctor is called a urologist. Or you may see a health care provider who specializes in kidney disorders. This type of doctor is called a nephrologist.

## What you can do
To get ready for your appointment:
- Ask if there's anything you need to do in advance,such as collect a urine sample.
- Take note of your symptoms,even if you're not sure they're related to aUTI.
- Make a list of all the medicines,vitamins or other supplements that you take.
- Write down questions to askyour health care provider.
For aUTI, basic questions to ask your provider include:
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- Are there any other possible causes?
- Do I need any tests to confirm the diagnosis?
- What factors do you think may have contributed to myUTI?
- What treatment approach do you recommend?
- If the first treatment doesn't work, what will you recommend next?
- Am I at risk of complications from this condition?
- What is the risk that this problem will come back?
- What steps can I take to lower the risk of the infection coming back?
- Should I see a specialist?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions as they occur to you during your appointment.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care provider will likely ask you several questions, including:
- When did you first notice your symptoms?
- Have you ever been treated for a bladder or kidney infection?
- How severe is your discomfort?
- How often do you urinate?
- Are your symptoms relieved by urinating?
- Do you have low back pain?
- Have you had a fever?
- Have you noticed vaginal discharge or blood in your urine?
- Are you sexually active?
- Do you use contraception? What kind?
- Could you be pregnant?
- Are you being treated for any other medical conditions?
- Have you ever used a catheter?

DISEASE NAME: HYPOTHYROIDISM (UNDERACTIVE THYROID)


## Overview
Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. This condition also is called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Over time, hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, such as high cholesterol and heart problems.
Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with thyroid hormone medicine usually is simple, safe and effective once you and your health care provider find the right dosage for you.

## Symptoms
The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years.
At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems.
Hypothyroidism symptoms may include:
- Tiredness.
- More sensitivity to cold.
- Constipation.
- Dry skin.
- Weight gain.
- Puffy face.
- Hoarse voice.
- Coarse hair and skin.
- Muscle weakness.
- Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness.
- Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular.
- Thinning hair.
- Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia.
- Depression.
- Memory problems.

## Hypothyroidism in infants
Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. They may include:
- Feeding problems.
- Poor growth.
- Poor weight gain.
- Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice.
- Constipation.
- Poor muscle tone.
- Dry skin.
- Hoarse crying.
- Enlarged tongue.
- A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia.
When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems.

## Hypothyroidism in children and teens
In general, children and teens with hypothyroidism have symptoms similar to those in adults. But they also may have:
- Poor growth that leads to short stature.
- Delayed development of permanent teeth.
- Delayed puberty.
- Poor mental development.

## When to see a doctor
See your health care provider if you're feeling tired for no reason or if you have other symptoms of hypothyroidism.
If you're taking thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism, follow your health care provider's advice on how often you need medical appointments. At first, you may need regular appointments to make sure you're receiving the right dose of medicine. Over time, you may need checkups so that your health care provider can monitor your condition and medicine.

## Causes
The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland makes two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). These hormones affect every cell in the body. They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. They help control body temperature. They have an effect on heart rate. And they help control how much protein the body makes.
Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough hormones. Conditions or problems that can lead to hypothyroidism include:
- Autoimmune disease.The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's disease. Autoimmune diseases happen when the immune system makes antibodies that attack healthy tissues. Sometimes that process involves the thyroid gland and affects its ability to make hormones.
- Thyroid surgery.Surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland can lower the gland's ability to make thyroid hormones or stop it completely.
- Radiation therapy.Radiation used to treat cancers of the head and neck can affect the thyroid gland and lead to hypothyroidism.
- Thyroiditis.Thyroiditis happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. This may be due to an infection. Or it can result from an autoimmune disorder or another medical condition affecting the thyroid. Thyroiditis can trigger the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone at once. That causes a spike in thyroid activity, a condition called hyperthyroidism. Afterward, the thyroid becomes underactive.
- Medicine.A number of medicines may lead to hypothyroidism. One such medicine is lithium, which is used to treat some psychiatric disorders. If you're taking medicine, ask your heath care provider about its effect on the thyroid gland.
Less often, hypothyroidism may be caused by:
- Problems present at birth.Some babies are born with a thyroid gland that doesn't work correctly. Others are born with no thyroid gland. In most cases, the reason the thyroid gland didn't develop properly is not clear. But some children have an inherited form of a thyroid disorder. Often, infants born with hypothyroidism don't have noticeable symptoms at first. That's one reason why most states require newborn thyroid screening.
- Pituitary disorder.A relatively rare cause of hypothyroidism is the failure of the pituitary gland to make enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This is usually because of a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland.
- Pregnancy.Some people develop hypothyroidism during or after pregnancy. If hypothyroidism happens during pregnancy and isn't treated, it raises the risk of pregnancy loss, premature delivery and preeclampsia. Preeclampsia causes a significant rise in blood pressure during the last three months of pregnancy. Hypothyroidism also can seriously affect the developing fetus.
- Not enough iodine.The thyroid gland needs the mineral iodine to make thyroid hormones. Iodine is found mainly in seafood, seaweed, plants grown in iodine-rich soil and iodized salt. Too little iodine can lead to hypothyroidism. Too much iodine can make hypothyroidism worse in people who already have the condition. In some parts of the world, it's common for people not to get enough iodine in their diets. The addition of iodine to table salt has almost eliminated this problem in the United States.

## Risk factors
Although anyone can develop hypothyroidism, you're at an increased risk if you:
- Are a woman.
- Have a family history of thyroid disease.
- Have an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease.
- Have received treatment for hyperthyroidism.
- Received radiation to your neck or upper chest.
- Have had thyroid surgery.

## Complications
Hypothyroidism that isn't treated can lead to other health problems, including:
- Goiter.Hypothyroidism may cause the thyroid gland to become larger. This condition is called a goiter. A large goiter may cause problems with swallowing or breathing.
- Heart problems.Hypothyroidism can lead to a higher risk of heart disease and heart failure. That's mainly because people with an underactive thyroid tend to develop high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the "bad" cholesterol.
- Peripheral neuropathy.Hypothyroidism that goes without treatment for a long time can damage the peripheral nerves. These are the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy may cause pain, numbness and tingling in the arms and legs.
- Infertility.Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which can limit fertility. Some of the causes of hypothyroidism, such as autoimmune disorders, also can harm fertility.
- Birth defects.Babies born to people with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared with babies born to mothers who do not have thyroid disease.Infants with hypothyroidism present at birth that goes untreated are at risk of serious physical and mental development problems. But if the condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of typical development are excellent.
Birth defects.Babies born to people with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of birth defects compared with babies born to mothers who do not have thyroid disease.
Infants with hypothyroidism present at birth that goes untreated are at risk of serious physical and mental development problems. But if the condition is diagnosed within the first few months of life, the chances of typical development are excellent.
- Myxedema coma.This rare, life-threatening condition can happen when hypothyroidism goes without treatment for a long time. A myxedema coma may be triggered by sedatives, infection or other stress on the body. Its symptoms include intense cold intolerance and drowsiness, followed by an extreme lack of energy and then unconsciousness. Myxedema coma requires emergency medical treatment.

DISEASE NAME: HYPOTHYROIDISM (UNDERACTIVE THYROID)


## Diagnosis
The symptoms of hypothyroidism can be different from person to person. And they often look like symptoms of other health problems. Because of that, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism doesn't rely on symptoms alone. It's usually based on the results of blood tests.
The first blood test typically done to diagnose hypothyroidism measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood. If it's high, the test is done again, along with a blood test for the thyroid hormoneT-4. If the results show thatTSHis high andT-4is low, then the diagnosis is hypothyroidism. In some cases, the thyroid hormoneT-3may be measured as well.
If the second test shows highTSHbutT-4andT-3are in the standard range, then the diagnosis is a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism. It usually doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms.
TSHtests also play an important role in managing hypothyroidism over time. They help your health care provider find and maintain the right dosage of medication for you.
The results of these blood tests can be affected by some medicines or supplements. This includes biotin, a vitamin taken as a stand-alone supplement or as part of a multivitamin. Before you have blood tests done, tell your health care provider about any medicines or supplements you take.

## Treatment
Treatment for hypothyroidism usually includes taking the thyroid hormone medicine levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others) every day. This medicine is taken by mouth. It returns hormone levels to a healthy range, eliminating symptoms of hypothyroidism.
You'll likely start to feel better one or two weeks after you begin treatment. Treatment with levothyroxine likely will be lifelong. Because the dosage you need may change, your health care provider may check yourTSHlevel every year.

## Finding the right dosage
To find the right dosage of levothyroxine for you, your health care provider checks your level ofTSHabout 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine. You may need another blood test to checkTSHagain six months later. Too much levothyroxine can cause side effects, such as:
- Tiredness.
- Increased appetite.
- Sleep problems.
- Shakiness.
- Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.
Levothyroxine typically causes no side effects when used in the correct dose. If you change brands of the medicine, tell your health care provider, as the dosage may need to change.
If you have coronary artery disease or severe hypothyroidism, your health care provider may start treatment with a smaller amount of medicine and then slowly increase the dosage. This allows your heart to adjust to the rise in your body's metabolism.

## Taking levothyroxine correctly
Levothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day. Ideally, you take the hormone in the morning, and then wait 30 to 60 minutes before you eat or take other medicine. If you take the medicine at bedtime, wait to take it until at least four hours after your last meal or snack.
Don't skip doses or stop taking the medicine because you feel better. If you do, it's likely that the symptoms of hypothyroidism will slowly return. If you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day.
Some medicines, supplements and even some foods may affect your body's ability to absorb levothyroxine. Talk to your health care provider if you eat large amounts of soy products, or if you typically eat a high-fiber diet. Also, tell your provider if you take other medicines, especially:
- Iron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron.
- Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids.
- Calcium supplements.

## Subclinical hypothyroidism
If you are diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, talk about treatment with your health care provider. For a mild rise inTSH, thyroid hormone medicine may not be useful. If yourTSHlevel is higher, but still in the subclinical range, thyroid hormones may improve some symptoms.

## Alternative medicine
Most health care providers recommend taking the medicine levothyroxine to treat hypothyroidism. But an extract containing thyroid hormone derived from the thyroid glands of pigs is available. It is sometimes called desiccated thyroid extract. However, this treatment is not recommended because the amount ofT-4andT-3in it may not be consistent from batch to batch. It is not safe for pregnant people to take desiccated thyroid extract because it can harm a fetus's development.

## Preparing for your appointment
You'll likely start by seeing your primary health care provider. Or you may be referred to a specialist in hormone disorders, called an endocrinologist. Infants with hypothyroidism need to see a pediatric endocrinologist right away. Children or teens can start with their primary health care provider. But they need to see a pediatric endocrinologist if there are any questions about levothyroxine or about the correct dosage of the medicine.
Here's information to help you get ready for your appointment and know what to expect from your health care provider.

## What you can do
- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do before you arrive.
- Write down any symptoms you're experiencing,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason you scheduled the appointment.
- Write down key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes.
- Make a list of all medicines,vitamins or supplements you're taking.
- Take a family member or friend along,if possible. Someone who goes with you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
- Write down questions to askyour health care provider.
Having a list of questions helps you make the most of your time with your health care provider. For hypothyroidism, some basic questions to ask include:
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely temporary or long lasting?
- What treatments are available, and which do you recommend?
- I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
- Are there restrictions I need to follow?
- Should I see a specialist?
- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
- Are there brochures or other printed material I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care provider is likely to ask you a number of questions, including:
- When did you begin experiencing symptoms?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
- What, if anything, makes your symptoms worse?
- Do you have a family history of thyroid disease?

DISEASE NAME: HYPERTHYROIDISM (OVERACTIVE THYROID)


## Overview
Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. This condition also is called overactive thyroid. Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism. That can cause many symptoms, such as weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.
Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. Anti-thyroid medicines and radioiodine can be used to slow the amount of hormones the thyroid gland makes. Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. In some cases, depending on what's causing it, hyperthyroidism may improve without medication or other treatment.

## Symptoms
Hyperthyroidism sometimes looks like other health problems. That can make it hard to diagnose. It can cause many symptoms, including:
- Losing weight without trying.
- Fast heartbeat, a condition called tachycardia.
- Irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmia.
- Pounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.
- Increased hunger.
- Nervousness, anxiety and irritability.
- Tremor, usually a small trembling in the hands and fingers.
- Sweating.
- Changes in menstrual cycles.
- Increased sensitivity to heat.
- Changes in bowel patterns, especially more-frequent bowel movements.
- Enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes called a goiter, which may appear as a swelling at the base of the neck.
- Tiredness.
- Muscle weakness.
- Sleep problems.
- Warm, moist skin.
- Thinning skin.
- Fine, brittle hair.
Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice. These symptoms may include an irregular heartbeat, weight loss, depression, and feeling weak or tired during ordinary activities.

## When to see a doctor
If you lose weight without trying, or if you notice a rapid heartbeat, unusual sweating, swelling at the base of your neck or other symptoms of hyperthyroidism, make an appointment with your health care provider. Tell your provider about all the symptoms you've noticed even if they are minor.
After a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, most people need regular follow-up visits with their health care provider to monitor the condition.

## Causes
Hyperthyroidism can be caused by several medical conditions that affect the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck. It has a big impact on the body. Every part of metabolism is controlled by hormones that the thyroid gland makes.
The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). These hormones affect every cell in the body. They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. They help control body temperature. They have an effect on heart rate. And they help control how much protein the body makes.
Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland puts too much of those thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. Conditions that can lead to hyperthyroidism include:
- Graves' disease.Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack the thyroid gland. That prompts the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.
- Overactive thyroid nodules.This condition also is called toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter and Plummer disease. This form of hyperthyroidism happens when a thyroid adenoma makes too much thyroid hormone. An adenoma is a part of the gland that is walled off from the rest of the gland. It forms noncancerous lumps that can make the thyroid bigger than usual.
- Thyroiditis.This condition happens when the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. In some cases, it's due to an autoimmune disorder. In others, the reason for it is unclear. The inflammation can cause extra thyroid hormone stored in the thyroid gland to leak into the bloodstream and cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

## Risk factors
Risk factors for hyperthyroidism include:
- A family history of thyroid disease, particularly Graves' disease.
- A personal history of certain chronic illnesses, including pernicious anemia and primary adrenal insufficiency.
- A recent pregnancy, which raises the risk of developing thyroiditis. This can lead to hyperthyroidism.

## Complications
Hyperthyroidism can lead to the following complications.

## Heart problems
Some of the most serious complications of hyperthyroidism involve the heart, including:
- A heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke.
- Congestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't circulate enough blood to meet the body's needs.

## Brittle bones
Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to weak, brittle bones. This condition is called osteoporosis. The strength of bones depends, in part, on the amount of calcium and other minerals in them. Too much thyroid hormone makes it hard for the body to get calcium into bones.

## Vision problems
Some people with hyperthyroidism develop a problem called thyroid eye disease. It's more common in people who smoke. This disorder affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes.
Symptoms of thyroid eye disease include:
- Bulging eyes.
- Gritty sensation in the eyes.
- Pressure or pain in the eyes.
- Puffy or retracted eyelids.
- Reddened or inflamed eyes.
- Light sensitivity.
- Double vision.
Eye problems that go untreated may cause vision loss.

## Discolored, swollen skin
In rare cases, people with Graves' disease develop Graves' dermopathy. This causes the skin to change colors and swell, often on the shins and feet.

## Thyrotoxic crisis
This rare condition also is called thyroid storm. Hyperthyroidism raises the risk of thyrotoxic crisis. It causes severe, sometimes life-threatening symptoms. It requires emergency medical care. Symptoms may include:
- Fever.
- Fast heartbeat.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Diarrhea.
- Dehydration.
- Confusion.
- Delirium.

DISEASE NAME: HYPERTHYROIDISM (OVERACTIVE THYROID)


## Diagnosis
Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed with a medical history, physical exam and blood tests. Depending on the results of the blood tests, you may need other tests too.
- Medical history and physical exam.During the exam, your health care provider may check for:Slight tremor in your fingers and hands.Overactive reflexes.Rapid or irregular pulse.Eye changes.Warm, moist skin.Your provider also examines your thyroid gland as you swallow to see if it's larger than usual, bumpy or tender.

Your provider also examines your thyroid gland as you swallow to see if it's larger than usual, bumpy or tender.
- Blood tests.Blood tests that measure the hormones T-4 and T-3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can confirm a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. A high level of T-4 and a low level ofTSHis common in people with hyperthyroidism.Blood tests are particularly important for older adults because they may not have classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism.Thyroid blood tests may give false results if you take biotin. Biotin is a B vitamin supplement that also may be found in multivitamins. Tell your health care provider if you are taking biotin or a multivitamin with biotin. To make sure your blood test is accurate, your health care provider may ask you to stop taking biotin 3 to 5 days before the test.

If blood test results show hyperthyroidism, your health care provider may suggest one of the following tests. They can help find out why your thyroid is overactive.
- Radioiodine scan and uptake test.For this test, you take a small, dose of radioactive iodine, called radioiodine, to see how much of it collects in your thyroid gland and where it collects in the gland.If your thyroid gland takes in a high amount of radioiodine, that means your thyroid gland is making too much thyroid hormone. The most likely cause is either Graves' disease or overactive thyroid nodules.If your thyroid gland takes in a low amount of radioiodine, that means hormones stored in the thyroid gland are leaking into the bloodstream. In that case, it's likely that you have thyroiditis.

If your thyroid gland takes in a low amount of radioiodine, that means hormones stored in the thyroid gland are leaking into the bloodstream. In that case, it's likely that you have thyroiditis.
- Thyroid ultrasound.This test uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the thyroid. Ultrasound may be better at finding thyroid nodules than are other tests. There's no exposure to radiation with this test, so it can be used for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or others who can't take radioiodine.

## Treatment
There are several treatments available for hyperthyroidism. The best approach for you depends on your age and health. The underlying cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is make a difference too. Your personal preference also should be considered as you and your health care provider decide on a treatment plan. Treatment may include:
- Anti-thyroid medicine.These medications slowly ease symptoms of hyperthyroidism by preventing the thyroid gland from making too many hormones. Anti-thyroid medications include methimazole and propylthiouracil. Symptoms usually begin to improve within several weeks to months.Treatment with anti-thyroid medicine typically lasts 12 to 18 months. After that, the dose may be slowly decreased or stopped if symptoms go away and if blood test results show that thyroid hormone levels have returned to the standard range. For some people, anti-thyroid medicine puts hyperthyroidism into long-term remission. But other people may find that hyperthyroidism comes back after this treatment.Although rare, serious liver damage can happen with both anti-thyroid medications. But because propylthiouracil has caused many more cases of liver damage, it's generally used only when people can't take methimazole. A small number of people who are allergic to these medicines may develop skin rashes, hives, fever or joint pain. They also can raise the risk of infection.

A small number of people who are allergic to these medicines may develop skin rashes, hives, fever or joint pain. They also can raise the risk of infection.
- Beta blockers.These medicines don't affect thyroid hormone levels. But they can lessen symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as a tremor, rapid heart rate and heart palpitations. Sometimes, health care providers prescribe them to ease symptoms until thyroid hormones are closer to a standard level. These medicines generally aren't recommended for people who have asthma. Side effects may include fatigue and sexual problems.
- Radioiodine therapy.The thyroid gland takes up radioiodine. This treatment causes the gland to shrink. This medicine is taken by mouth. With this treatment, symptoms typically lessen within several months. This treatment usually causes thyroid activity to slow enough to make the thyroid gland underactive. That condition is hypothyroidism. Because of that, over time, you may need to take medicine to replace thyroid hormones.
- Thyroidectomy.This is surgery to remove part of or all of the thyroid gland. It is not used often to treat hyperthyroidism. But it may be an option for people who are pregnant. It also may be a choice for those who can't take anti-thyroid medicine and don't want to or can't take radioiodine therapy.Risks of this surgery include damage to the vocal cords and parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands on the back of the thyroid. They help control the level of calcium in the blood.People who have a thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy need lifelong treatment with the medicine levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, others). It supplies the body with thyroid hormones. If the parathyroid glands are removed during surgery, medicine also is needed to keep blood calcium in a healthy range.

## Thyroid eye disease
If you have thyroid eye disease, you may be able to manage mild symptoms with self-care steps, such as artificial tear drops and lubricating eye gels. Avoiding wind and bright lights can help too.
More-severe symptoms may need treatment with medicine called corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or prednisone. They can lessen swelling behind the eyeballs. The medicine teprotumumab (Tepezza) also may be used to control moderate to severe symptoms. If those medicines don't ease symptoms, other medicines are sometimes used to treat thyroid eye disease. They include, tocilizumab (Actemra), rituximab (Rituxan) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept).
In some cases, surgery may be needed to treat thyroid eye disease, including:
- Orbital decompression surgery.In this surgery, the bone between the eye socket and the sinuses is removed. This surgery can improve vision. It also gives the eyes more room, so they can go back to their usual position. There is a risk of complications with this surgery. If you have double vision before the surgery, it may not go away afterward. Some people develop double vision after the surgery.
- Eye muscle surgery.Sometimes scar tissue from thyroid eye disease can cause one or more eye muscles to be too short. This pulls the eyes out of alignment, causing double vision. Eye muscle surgery may correct double vision by cutting the muscle from the eyeball and attaching it again farther back.

## Lifestyle and home remedies
Once you begin treatment, symptoms of hyperthyroidism likely will get better. Along with your treatment, your health care provider might suggest that you reduce iodine in your diet. It can make hyperthyroidism worse. Kelp, dulse and other types of seaweed contain a lot of iodine. Cough syrup and multivitamins also may contain iodine.

## Graves' disease
If you have Graves' disease that causes eye or skin problems, taking the following steps may help ease symptoms:
- Don't smoke.Smoking has been linked to the development of thyroid eye disease. It also can make that condition worse. And smoking can cause symptoms to come back after treatment.
- Keep your eyes lubricated.Eye drops may help relieve dryness and scratchiness. A cool compress also can provide moisture. If your eyes don't completely close, a lubricating gel at bedtime may help keep the cornea from drying out. Some people also tape their eyelids shut while they sleep.
- Protect your eyes.Wear sunglasses to help protect your eyes from the sun and wind.
- Keep your head up.Raising the head of your bed may lessen swelling and ease pressure on your eyes.
- Use creams for swollen skin.Creams containing hydrocortisone that you can buy without a prescription (Cortizone 10, others) may help ease swollen skin on the shins and feet. For help finding these creams, ask a pharmacist.

## Coping and support
If you've been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, it's important that you get the medical care you need. After you and your health care provider have decided on a treatment plan, there also are some things you can do to cope with the condition and help your body heal.
- Get regular exercise.Exercise can help you feel better. It improves muscle tone and helps keep your heart and lungs healthy. Exercise also can help you feel more energetic.
- Learn relaxation techniques.Many relaxation techniques can help you keep a positive outlook, especially when coping with illness. Research has shown that for Graves' disease in particular, stress is a risk factor. Learning to relax and find a sense of calm may help sustain your physical and mental well-being.

## Preparing for your appointment
You'll likely start by seeing your primary care provider. But you may be referred directly to a specialist in hormone disorders, called an endocrinologist. If you have eye problems, you may be referred to an eye doctor, also called an ophthalmologist.
Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and to know what to expect from your health care provider.

## What you can do
- Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do to get ready for it, such as not eat or drink for a certain amount of time.
- Write down any symptoms you have,including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
- Write down key personal information,including any major stresses or recent life changes.
- Make a list of all medicines,vitamins or supplements you're taking, especially any supplements or vitamins containing biotin.
- Take a family member or friend along,if possible. Someone who is there with you may remember information you missed or forgot.
- Write down questions to askyour health care provider.
Writing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your health care provider. For hyperthyroidism, some questions to ask include:
- What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?
- Are there other possible causes?
- What tests do I need?
- Is my condition likely temporary or long lasting?
- What treatment options are available, and which do you recommend for me?
- I have other health conditions. How can I manage these conditions together?
- Should I see a specialist?
- Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
- Do you have brochures or other printed material I can take? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions.

## What to expect from your doctor
Your health care provider is likely to ask you some questions, including:
- When did your symptoms begin?
- Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?
- How severe are your symptoms?
- What, if anything, makes your symptoms better?
- What, if anything, makes your symptoms worse?
- Do members of your family have thyroid disease?
- Have you had any recent radiology scans that used intravenous contrast?

DISEASE NAME: CAVITIES AND TOOTH DECAY


## Overview
Cavities are areas in the hard surface of your teeth that are damaged. These areas of tooth decay become tiny openings or holes that can lead to a serious toothache, infection and tooth loss. There are several causes of cavities, including bacteria in your mouth, snacking a lot, sipping sugary drinks and not cleaning your teeth well.
Cavities and tooth decay are among the world's most common health problems. They're especially common in children, teenagers and older adults. But anyone who has teeth can get cavities, including babies.
If cavities aren't treated, they get larger and affect deeper layers of your teeth. Regular dental visits and good brushing and flossing habits are the best ways to protect your teeth from cavities.

## Symptoms
The symptoms of cavities vary, depending on how many you have and where they're located. When a cavity is just beginning, you may not have any symptoms. As the decay gets larger, it may cause symptoms such as:
- Toothache and other pain.
- Tooth sensitivity.
- Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold.
- Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see.
- Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth.
- Pain when you bite down.

## When to see a dentist
You may not be aware that a cavity is forming. That's why it's important to have regular dental checkups and cleanings, even when your mouth feels fine. But if you have a toothache or mouth pain, see your dentist as soon as possible.

## Causes
Tooth decay causes cavities. This is a process that occurs over time.
Here's how tooth decay happens:
- Plaque forms.Dental plaque is a clear sticky film that coats your teeth. It's due to eating a lot of sugars and starches and not cleaning your teeth well. When you don't clean sugars and starches off your teeth, bacteria quickly begin feeding on them and forming plaque. Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under or above your gumline into tartar. Tartar makes plaque harder to remove and creates a shield for bacteria. A dental professional needs to remove this plaque.
- Plaque attacks.The acids from bacteria remove minerals in your tooth's hard, outer enamel. This erosion causes tiny openings or holes in the enamel — the first stage of cavities. Once areas of enamel are worn away, the bacteria and acid can reach the next layer of your teeth, called dentin. This layer is softer than enamel and less resistant to acid, causing your teeth to be more sensitive.
- Damage continues.As tooth decay happens, the bacteria and acid move through your teeth to the inner tooth material (pulp) that contains nerves and blood vessels. The pulp becomes swollen and irritated from the bacteria. Because there is no place for the swelling to expand inside of a tooth, the nerve becomes pressed, causing pain. Sometimes pain and damage can spread outside of the tooth root to the bone, causing bone loss around the tooth and even reaching nearby teeth.

## Risk factors
Anyone who has teeth can get cavities, but these factors raise the risk:
- Tooth location.Decay most often occurs in your back teeth — your molars and premolars. These teeth have lots of grooves, pits and crannies, and multiple roots that can collect food particles. That's why they're harder to keep clean than your smoother, easy-to-reach front teeth.
- Certain foods and drinks.Foods that cling to your teeth for a long time are more likely to cause decay than foods that are easily washed away by saliva. These foods include milk, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips.
- Snacking or sipping a lot.When you snack or sip sugary drinks a lot, you give mouth bacteria more fuel to make acids that attack your teeth and wear them down. And sipping soda or other acidic drinks throughout the day helps create a continual acid bath over your teeth.
- Bedtime baby feeding.When babies are given bedtime bottles filled with milk, formula, juice or other liquids that have sugar, these beverages remain on their teeth for hours while they sleep. This feeds bacteria that can cause decay. This damage often is called baby bottle tooth decay. Similar damage can occur when toddlers wander around drinking from a sippy cup filled with these beverages.
- Not brushing your teeth well.If you don't clean your teeth soon after eating and drinking, plaque forms quickly, and the first stages of decay and gingivitis can begin.
- Not getting enough fluoride.Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, helps prevent cavities. It also can reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage. Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies. It's also a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouth rinses. But bottled water usually does not contain fluoride.
- Younger or older age.In the U.S., cavities are common in very young children and teenagers. Older adults also are at higher risk. Over time, teeth can wear down and gums may recede, making teeth more likely to decay. Older adults also may use more medicines that reduce saliva flow, raising the risk of tooth decay.
- Dry mouth.Dry mouth is caused by a lack of saliva. Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from your teeth. Substances found in saliva also help counter the acid produced by bacteria. Certain medicines, some medical conditions, radiation to your head or neck, or certain chemotherapy drugs can raise your risk of cavities by reducing saliva production.
- Worn fillings or dental devices.Over the years, dental fillings can weaken, begin to break down or get rough edges. This allows plaque to build up more easily and makes it harder to remove. Dental devices can stop fitting well, allowing decay to begin under them.
- Heartburn.Heartburn, a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause stomach acid to flow into your mouth. This is called reflux. It can wear away the enamel of your teeth and cause a lot of damage. This exposes more of the dentin to bacteria, creating tooth decay. Your dentist may recommend that you talk with your healthcare professional to see if GERD is causing your enamel loss.
- Eating disorders.Anorexia and bulimia can lead to a lot of tooth erosion and cavities. Stomach acid from repeated vomiting, called purging, washes over the teeth and begins eating away at the enamel. Eating disorders also can get in the way of saliva production.

## Complications
Cavities and tooth decay are so common that you may not take them seriously. And you may think that it doesn't matter if children get cavities in their baby teeth. But cavities and tooth decay can have serious and lasting complications, even for children who don't have their permanent teeth yet.
Complications of cavities may include:
- Pain.
- Abscess — a bacterial infection that causes a pocket of pus to form in a tooth.
- Swelling or pus around a tooth.
- Damage or broken teeth.
- Chewing problems.
- Positioning shifts of teeth after tooth loss.
When cavities and decay become serious, you may have:
- Pain that makes it hard to live your daily life.
- Weight loss or nutrition problems because it's painful or difficult to eat or chew.
- Tooth loss, which may affect your appearance, confidence and self-esteem.
- In rare cases, a tooth abscess, which can lead to more-serious or even life-threatening infections.

## Prevention
Good oral and dental hygiene can help keep you from getting cavities. Here are some tips to help prevent cavities. Ask your dentist which tips are best for you.
- Brush with fluoride toothpaste after eating or drinking.Brush your teeth at least twice a day, and ideally after every meal, using toothpaste with fluoride. To clean between your teeth, floss or use an interdental cleaner. This cleaner helps reach areas where a toothbrush can't reach.
- Rinse your mouth.If your dentist feels that you have a high risk of getting cavities, a mouth rinse with fluoride may be recommended.
- Visit your dentist regularly.Get professional teeth cleanings and regular oral exams, which can help prevent problems or spot them early. Your dentist can recommend a schedule that's best for you.
- Consider dental sealants.A sealant is a protective plastic coating applied to the chewing surface of back teeth. It seals off grooves and crannies that tend to collect food, protecting tooth enamel from plaque and acid. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends sealants for all school-age children. Sealants may last for several years before they need to be replaced, but they need to be checked regularly.
- Drink some tap water.Most public water supplies have added fluoride, which can reduce tooth decay greatly. If you drink only bottled water that doesn't contain fluoride, you'll miss out on the benefits of fluoride.
- Avoid snacking and sipping a lot.Whenever you eat or drink beverages other than water, you help your mouth bacteria create acids that can destroy tooth enamel. If you snack or drink throughout the day, your teeth are under constant attack.
- Eat tooth-healthy foods.Some foods and beverages are better for your teeth than others. Avoid foods that get stuck in grooves and pits of your teeth for long periods, or brush soon after eating them. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables increase saliva flow, and unsweetened coffee, tea and sugar-free gum help wash away food particles.
- Consider fluoride treatments.Your dentist may recommend periodic fluoride treatments, especially if you aren't getting enough fluoride through fluoridated drinking water and other sources. Your dentist also may recommend custom trays that fit over your teeth to apply prescription fluoride if your risk of tooth decay is very high.
- Ask about antiseptic and disinfecting treatments.If tooth decay is likely — for example, because of a medical condition — your dentist may recommend special antiseptic and disinfecting mouth rinses like chlorhexidine or other treatments to cut down on harmful bacteria in your mouth. Unless your dentist tells you otherwise, mouth rinses, also called mouthwash, generally are not recommended for children younger than the age of 6 so they don't swallow too much of it.
- Combined treatments.Chewing sugar-free gum along with prescription fluoride and an antibacterial rinse can help reduce the risk of cavities. But in some people, xylitol, which is often found in sugar-free gum or sugar-free candies, may cause gas or diarrhea if consumed in large amounts.

DISEASE NAME: CAVITIES AND TOOTH DECAY


## Diagnosis
Your dentist usually can detect tooth decay by:
- Asking about tooth pain and sensitivity.
- Looking around inside your mouth and at your teeth.
- Probing your teeth with dental instruments to check for soft areas.
- Looking at dental X-rays, which can show where cavities and decay are.
Your dentist also can tell you which of the three types of cavities you have: smooth surface, pit and fissure, or root.

## Treatment
Regular checkups can find cavities and other dental issues before they lead to more-serious problems. The sooner you seek care, the better your chances of reversing the earliest stages of tooth decay and stopping it from getting worse. If a cavity is treated before it starts causing pain, you probably won't need a lot of treatment.
Treatment of cavities depends on how serious they are and your situation. Treatment options include:
- Fluoride treatments.If your cavity just started, a fluoride treatment may help restore your tooth's enamel and can sometimes reverse a cavity in the very early stages. Professional fluoride treatments contain more fluoride than the amount found in tap water, toothpaste and mouth rinses. Fluoride treatments may be liquid, gel, foam or varnish that's brushed onto your teeth or placed in a small tray that fits over your teeth.
- Fillings.Fillings, also called restorations, are the main treatment option. Fillings are made of various materials, such as tooth-colored composite resin or porcelain, or dental amalgam that is a mixture of several materials.
- Crowns.If you have a lot of decay or weakened teeth, you may need a crown — a custom-fitted covering that replaces your tooth's entire natural crown. The crown helps protect the soundness of the tooth and lowers the risk of fracture. Your dentist drills away the decayed area and enough of the rest of your tooth to ensure a good fit. Crowns may be made of gold, high-strength porcelain, resin, porcelain fused to metal or other materials.
- Root canals.When decay reaches the inner material of your tooth, called the pulp, you may need a root canal. This is a treatment to repair and save a badly damaged or infected tooth instead of removing it. The diseased tooth pulp is removed. Medicine is sometimes put into the root canal to clear any infection. Then the pulp is replaced with a filling.
- Tooth extractions.Some teeth become so seriously decayed that they can't be restored and must be removed. Having a tooth pulled can leave a gap that allows your other teeth to shift. If possible, consider getting a bridge or a dental implant to replace the missing tooth.

## Preparing for your appointment
If you're having pain or sensitivity in your teeth, make an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

## Preparing for an appointment
Before your appointment, make a list of:
- All medicines,vitamins, herbal remedies or other supplements you're taking, and doses.
- Any allergies to medicinesor bad reactions you've had to local anesthetics.
- Bring in any mouthguards or oral appliancesthat you wear.
- Questions to askyour dentist.
Basic questions to ask your dentist may include:
- Do I have a simple cavity, or do I need a crown or a root canal?
- How many visits will it take to treat this tooth?
- When will the pain go away?
- What can I take for the pain?
- How long should I wait before I eat or drink after this procedure?
- Are there other steps I can take to prevent cavities?
- Does my local water supply contain added fluoride?
- Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.

## What to expect from your dentist
Your dentist may ask you some questions. Be ready to answer them to save time to go over topics you want to focus on. Questions may include:
- Do extremes in food temperature or sweet foods cause you pain?
